How much are tickets to see Tina Fey and Amy Poehler live in 2024 ? Forget the ‘ Arab Street , ’ US Navy ’ s suicide problem and other commentary New York ’ s governor finally sees reality — and responsibility New Yorkers grin and bear the city ’ s high cost of living , but the high cost of government is enough to send anyone through the roof . That ’ s what happened when five City Council members recently discovered that the city ’ s Parks Department spends $ 3,600 a pop to replace a tree — more than seven times what neighboring Jersey City pays . Gotham replaces around 20,000 of its 666,000 trees each year , meaning it spends $ 72 million on tree replacement annually . Yet across the Hudson , Jersey City pays just $ 500 each . That , understandably , got the councilmen to fire off a letter asking — only slightly jokingly — if that city could do Gotham ’ s tree-planting instead . But the city ’ s cost premium doesn ’ t end with trees . In Jersey City , a new 53,000-square-foot charter school has a $ 12.5 million price tag . In the Bronx , a 46,000-square-foot charter school expansion will cost $ 70 million . Some years back , The New York Times found that laying a mile of subway track here ran seven times as much as in other major cities . You can blame union costs , prevailing-wage laws , bloated bureaucracies , poor oversight . . . but in the end , the buck stops with New York ’ s elected officials : its mayor , governor and lawmakers . Instead of moving away , fed-up New Yorkers might just consider voting for someone else for a change .

This amount is seven times more than what Jersey City, located across the Hudson, spends for its trees which is only about $500 each. The monumental cost difference has sparked criticism and jest, as council members have suggested that Jersey City could potentially take over Gotham's tree planting duties. New York's high costs are not limited to tree planting but also extend to larger projects such as the construction of charter schools and subway track installation.""]"

Bungie said publicly on Friday that the leak came from a recent Summit , and that the breach of trust may affect future events as a result . In a DM conversation with me on Friday night , Ekuegan confirmed that he has been accused of being the source of the leak by Bungie . Ekuegan is a high-profile Destiny 2 streamer and YouTuber who is famous for having run over 6,000 Grandmaster Nightfalls . I actually previously interviewed him , given his achievements in the game . On Friday , hours before Bungie ’ s tweet , Ekuegan abruptly announced he would no longer be playing Destiny 2 going forward , and made an offhand comment about how “ the studio made a decision ” before deleting a number of his own VODs . That led some to begin to suspect him . This morning , he denied being the leaker in a series of tweets with the replies locked . Ekuegan did attend the virtual Summit in question , and he ’ s been to four Summits in total , invited as a high-skill PvE player . He has now been banned from Destiny 2 and Bungie will no longer collaborate with him , but they said they considered the matter “ closed ” and would not be pursuing legal action against him at this time for breaking his NDA . But like Ekuegan has said publicly , privately he vehemently denies being the leaker . The first thing he said when I contacted him was that he was being framed . And a consistent thing he kept bringing up in our conversation was something I imagine most people are asking . Why ? Why would he do this ? “ I 'm in so many NDAs [ at the moment ] , why would I breach any ? it 's part of the job , ” Ekuegan said . “ I spent 14,000 hours on this game , multiple hours helping people in Grandmasters. ” Destiny 2Bungie MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor Bungie told him that they confirmed it was him by matching desktop icons from his own homescreen , frequently displayed on his stream . Ekuegan maintains he did not take any photos , and believes someone from the leaks Discord may have tacked his icons onto the photos to point a finger at him . He denies knowing FreezingDart , the Discord user who was sharing information from the Summit . One of the screenshots does in fact match many icons from Ekuegan ’ s PC . It ’ s apparent someone first recorded the showcase , and was playing it back on the PC to take photos of the relevant slides . Ekuegan maintains he didn ’ t do this . “ There 's so many screenshots , bro I have never taken a pic in my life , shoot my phone can be audited for god 's sake . I would of just screenshot on my computer , I use Sniping tool for that , ” he says . Regardless of Ekuegan ’ s claims , he is the one Bungie has identified as the source of the leak , and they do not seem to be pursuing any other leads . Ekuegan says he does not have any idea who the leaker might be , but he seems to have accepted the decision and says he will try to “ stay positive ” and move on . “ Being painted as [ a leaker ] is gon na be annoying , but that ’ s a road with this community . No one is there to uplift all the great things you do , but they ’ re fast to try to break you down . That ’ s just life. ” Though I would not expect Bungie to comment on this matter , given the situation , I have reached out to them to see if they can elaborate on this further , but have not heard back yet . While no legal action is being pursued at this point , it seems , that could theoretically change in the future .

Kamala Harris attacked then-former Vice President Joe Biden . The exchange led much of the media coverage of the debate and prompted questions later about whether Biden , the eventual Democratic presidential nominee , would consider Harris as a running mate. “ Anyone remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate : ‘ You will do whatever the Chinese tell you ! They gave your son over a billion dollars , ” the April 24 Facebook post says . The text sits over a cropped image of Biden and Harris facing off behind lecterns on the debate stage . But Harris didn ’ t say that . Transcripts of the debates where Harris and Biden shared the stage show no such exchange.Harris ’ jab at Biden was over his work with segregationist senators and opposition to school busing in the 1970s , not Biden ’ s stance on China.The April 24 post has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.Fact check : Kamala Harris ’ children ’ s book is not in ‘ welcome packs ’ for migrantsThe Facebook user who shared the image did not respond to a request for comment.Reading the transcriptsHarris suspended her campaign for president on Dec. 3 , 2019 , about two weeks before the sixth debate in the Democratic presidential primary.Before dropping out of the race , Harris was on stage for all five primary debates . But transcripts of the debates from the service Rev and The Washington Post show she didn ’ t say the quote attributed to her in the meme.Harris ’ office declined to comment on the claim in the meme.The only significant mention of China by Harris during those debates was in response to a question about trade policy during the September 2019 debate . ABC News host and debate moderator George Stephanopolous asked Harris how her trade policy would differ from former President Barack Obama ’ s.After answering , Harris pivoted to what she called a “ complicated ” relationship with China , according to the Rev transcript . “ We have to hold China accountable , ” she said . “ They steal our products , including our intellectual property . They dump substandard products into our economy . They need to be held accountable . We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that presents . We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. ” Harris also did n't bring up Biden 's son , the transcripts show . President Donald Trump and his supporters frequently invoked Hunter Biden during the 2020 campaign , accusing him of profiting off political connections , including in China.In December , Hunter Biden confirmed that he was the subject of a Department of Justice investigation into his finances . The Associated Press reported part of the investigation was into Hunter Biden 's `` past work in China . `` Fact check : Biden did n't say July 4 celebrations may be canceled if people do n't get COVID vaccinationsA search for other instances where Harris might have said the quote also did not return any credible results.Transcripts of the debates did not show any other Democratic candidate attacking Biden with a similar quote either . During the two general election debates , Trump attacked Biden over China.Tense exchangeWhile Harris did not say the quote attributed to her about China , she did go after Biden during the first Democratic presidential primary debate in June 2019.The photo used in the meme was from that exchange . In the original image , Biden grips the podium on the left side of the frame while Harris , on the far right , holds a pen as she points with her right hand.Sen . Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , stands behind his own lectern between the two candidates . The meme cropped out Sanders to show Biden and Harris face-to-face.Fact check : Video lacks context about Harris ' debate criticism of Biden 's record on raceAbout an hour into the debate , Harris jumped in to say she wanted to “ speak on the issue of race. ” She said she believed Biden was not a racist , but questioned the way Biden spoke of segregationist Sens .

The former kickboxer rose to fame in 2016 when he was removed from British TV show Big Brother over a video which appeared to show him attacking a woman.He went on to gain notoriety online , with Twitter banning him for saying women should `` bear responsibility '' for being sexually assaulted . He has since been reinstated . Despite social media bans he gained popularity , particularly among young men , by promoting an ultra-masculine , ultra-luxurious lifestyle.He regularly appeared in videos with a fleet of expensive sports cars , on private jets , and enjoying expensive holidays .

A judge will rule on the application on Friday , the spokesperson added . The brothers have been under investigation since April alongside two Romanian nationals . During the detention hearing , the two brothers maintained their right to silence , their lawyer told the BBC . `` The four suspects ... appear to have created an organised crime group with the purpose of recruiting , housing and exploiting women by forcing them to create pornographic content meant to be seen on specialised websites for a cost , '' DIICOT said in a statement . Video on social media showed Tate and his brother being led away from a luxury villa.A spokesperson for Tate told the Daily Mirror that he could not provide details relating to the arrest . `` However , Andrew and Tristan Tate have the utmost respect for the Romanian authorities and will always assist and help in any way they can , '' he added.Later , a tweet was sent from Andrew Tate 's Twitter account alluding to the 1999 movie The Matrix , a film he regularly refers to in his posts . `` The Matrix sent their agents , '' the post said . The account also retweeted Matrix memes posted by Twitter owner Elon Musk.Image source , ReutersImage caption , Andrew Tate was detained with his brother , Tristan , after having his house raided in the Romanian capitalOn Thursday night , Romania 's Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism issued a statement , but did not name the Tate brothers , stating that two British citizens and two Romanian citizens were suspected of being part of a human trafficking group.The statement said officers had identified six people who were `` sexually exploited '' by what it called an `` organised criminal group '' . Police alleged the victims were `` recruited '' by the British citizens , who they said had misrepresented their intention to enter into a relationship with the victims - which it called `` the loverboy method '' . They were later forced to perform in pornographic content under threat of violence , the statement said . Police also released a video of the raid , showing guns , knives , and money on display in one room.Tate moved to Romania five years ago . Rumours swirled online that police were tipped off to Tate 's presence in the country when he posted a video taking aim at the environmental activist Greta Thunberg . In the footage he posted , he was handed a pizza box from a local restaurant , which some users suggested had inadvertently revealed his location.However , the pizza box is not thought to be relevant.The row with the activist began earlier this week when Tate , 36 , tagged the 19-year-old in a post boasting about the `` enormous emissions '' produced by his fleet of cars . Following the arrest , she tweeted `` this is what happens when you do n't recycle your pizza boxes , '' referring to the online rumour . Image source , Reuters/Digi24Image caption , Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan led away from a police stationPrior to his worldwide notoriety , Tate - a British citizen who was born in the US - fought professionally as a kickboxer and won world titles . In 2016 , he entered the Big Brother house but was soon removed after a video appeared to show him hitting a woman with a belt.At the time of his expulsion , Tate said the video had been edited , calling it `` a total lie trying to make me look bad '' .Mr Tate has been banned from social media platforms like YouTube , Facebook and Instagram , with TikTok also removing him , saying `` misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated '' .He had been banned from Twitter but was recently allowed back onto the platform following Elon Musk 's takeover.Read more : Andrew Tate , the self-proclaimed misogynistRelated TopicsAndrew TateRomaniaTop StoriesHaley and DeSantis trade insults at heated Iowa debatePublished5 hours agoChristie exits 2024 race with parting shot at TrumpPublished12 hours agoIsrael officials want Gaza destruction , court toldPublished1 hour agoFeaturesLove and longing across the Taiwan Strait : The view from ChinaWhat""]","['Controversial online influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have been detained in Romania in connection with a human trafficking and rape investigation.

'' Fake news Crime Pop Culture PunditFact The Newly Press Allison Mack , left , leaves federal court Tuesday , April 24 , 2018 , in the Brooklyn borough of New York . Federal prosecutors say the television actress best known for playing a young Superman 's close friend has been charged with sex trafficking . ( AP ) By Amy Sherman May 1 , 2018 Smallville actress did n't confess to selling children to Clintons A website twisted a real story about a criminal indictment against TV actress Allison Mack and made up details trying to tie her crime to the Clintons . `` Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons , '' stated an April 29 headline by The Newly Press . The same story appeared on the clickbait website Your News Wire . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated , as part of the social network ’ s efforts to combat online hoaxes . Mack was indeed indicted , but the tie to the Rothschilds or Clintons is made up . On Smallville , Mack played the role of Chloe Sullivan , one of Clark Kent ’ s best friends , starting in 2001 . Federal prosecutors in New York announced April 20 that Mack , 35 , had been arrested . An unsealed indictment showed she and Keith Raniere faced charges for sex trafficking , sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy . Prosecutors said that Mack recruited women to join what was portrayed as a female mentorship group that was led by Raniere . `` The victims were then exploited , both sexually and for their labor , to the defendants ’ benefit , '' stated Richard P. Donoghue , United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York . Raniere established a series of purported self-help programs within his umbrella organization Nxivm , based in Albany . Prosecutors said that Nxivm maintained features of a pyramid scheme , as its courses cost thousands of dollars each and participants ( `` Nxians '' ) were encouraged to recruit others . Featured Fact-check Bloggers stated on May 29 , 2017 in Internet rumors President Donald Trump `` announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with . '' By Aaron Sharockman • May 30 , 2017 In 2015 , Raniere created a secret society within Nxivm called DOS , an acronym that stands for a Latin phrase that loosely translates to `` Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions , '' or `` The Vow , '' according to prosecutors . DOS operated with levels of women `` slaves '' headed by `` masters . '' Raniere stood at the top of the pyramid while Mack was one of the women in the first level immediately below Raniere . While The Newly Press article said that Mack confessed , court records show Mack pleaded not guilty on April 20 . She was released on $ 5 million bail bond and is staying at her parents ’ home in California under electronic monitoring . The Newly Press story provided no evidence that Mack confessed to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons . Instead , the story tried to force a link by tying a financial backer of Raniere -- Seagram heiresses Sara and Clare Bronfman -- with business interests of the Rothschilds and the Clinton Foundation . While prosecutors wrote in a court document that Clare Bronfman has given Raniere millions of dollars over the years , the document makes no mention of Bill and Hillary Clinton or the Rothschilds , a famous wealthy family in the banking business . The press release and the indictment also make no mention of the Rothschilds or the Clintons . We searched news accounts and found none that tied the Clintons or Rothschilds to the indictment . Our ruling A headline said , `` Smallville star confesses she sold children to Rothschilds and Clintons . '' Actress Allison Mack was indicted for sex trafficking , but the allegation that she confessed to selling children to the Rothschilds and Clintons is clickbait and fictional . Mack has pleaded not guilty .

Fox joked that doesn ’ t leave much time for double dates . Fox got emotional during the interview talking about her three sons and how she talked to them about gender identity given that her oldest , Noah , started wearing dresses when he was two years old , she said . According to Fox , she said she “ bought a bunch of books that sort of addressed these things and addressed a full spectrum of what this is . Some of the books are written by transgender children. ” “ Some of the books are just about how you can be a boy and wear a dress ; you can express yourself through your clothing however you want . And that doesn ’ t even have to have anything to do with your sexuality , ” she said . “ So from the time they were very young , I ’ ve incorporated those things into their daily lives so that nobody feels like they are weird or strange or different. ” Fox said she keeps her children off of social media , which she thinks is “ sinister , ” though she acknowledged she has accounts herself that someone runs for her .

'' Schneider : `` In this case it 's the literal truth . We 're on holy ground . '' ―Elsa Schneider and Marcus Brody [ src ] The Biblioteca di San Barnaba was a library on Piazza San Marco , at the site of San Barnaba , near the Canale Grande in Venice , Italy [ 1 ] . The library building was originally a medieval or Renaissance church [ 2 ] , and contained columns brought back as spoils of war from the sacking of Byzantium during the Fourth Crusade . It also contained stained glass windows with images of the knights of the Crusades , and mysterious Roman numerals . The church itself had been built over the site of a monastery run by early Christian monks , who had built the catacombs that lay under the city . [ 3 ] Contents 1 History 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Sources 5 Notes and references 6 External links History [ ] `` The tomb is somewhere in the library . You said yourself it used to be a church . '' ―Indiana Jones [ src ] In 1938 , Holy Grail historian Henry Jones , Sr. and Elsa Schneider went to the library to help find the tomb of one of the Grail knights , as part of an expedition financed by Walter Donovan . Jones was on the track of discovering the Knight 's tomb below the church when he realized that Schneider was a Nazi agent , and sent his Grail Diary to his son for safety . Jones was then kidnapped by Nazi agents and taken to Castle Brunwald . Donovan then hired Indiana Jones to pick up in his father 's place , and the younger Jones and Marcus Brody traveled to Venice , and met Schneider , who took them to the library . She revealed a clue left behind by the senior Jones involving Roman numerals . From reading his father 's diary , Indy realized that the tomb was somewhere in the church , and used the Roman numerals to find the spot to enter the catacombs . Breaking through the tiled floor with a cordon post ( and puzzling a librarian with the noise ) , Jones discovered a way into the catacombs . While Jones and Schneider slipped below the library , Brody was ambushed by Kazim and his men from the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword , who dragged Brody 's unconscious body away , and then followed Jones into the underground tombs . After finding the Knight 's tomb and escaping a fire set in the catacombs by Kazim , Jones and Schneider emerged from a manhole in the piazza in front of the library . Kazim 's men spied the wet pair and chased them to the docks , where the pursuit continued by motorboat . [ 4 ] A Venetian newspaper , La Gazzetta di Venezia covered the damage to the library , and the speedboat chase . Indiana Jones kept a clipping of the article `` Ugly American on Rampage '' in his journal . The article blamed an unidentified American tourist for smashing the library floor , causing a fire below the library , and leading speedboats on a chase through the docks . [ 5 ] Behind the scenes [ ] The exterior shots of the library are actually the Church of San Barnaba in Venice , located in the neighborhood of Campo San Barnaba , west of the Grand Canal . The novelization of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade identifies the building as that of Marciana Library on Piazza San Marco . [ 6 ] Indiana Jones : The Ultimate Guide confirms that the library is on Piazza San Marco , which is the main piazza of Venice , and home of St. Mark 's Basilica , and which is located east of the Grand Canal . [ 3 ] The Lost Journal""]","['The Biblioteca di San Barnaba is a notable location from the Indiana Jones franchise, specifically in the film ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" The library is located in Venice, Italy, and was originally a medieval or Renaissance church built over an early Christian monastery. The church contained columns from the sacking of Byzantium during the Fourth Crusade, stained glass windows depicting knights of the crusades, and mysterious Roman numerals. In 1938, characters Henry Jones, Sr. and Elsa Schneider visited the library in search of the tomb of a Grail knight. Following a series of events including Henry Jones, Sr.\'s kidnapping, Indiana Jones and Marcus Brody later entered the catacombs beneath the library.']"

While NPR shares a mission with our stations , we are funded in significantly different ways . Special Series Organization Mission Strategic Plan History Stations Collaborative Journalism Finances Public Radio Finances Updated August 15 , 202311:19 AM ET Originally published June 20 , 20134:23 PM ET While NPR shares a mission with our stations , we are funded in significantly different but interrelated ways . Get an overview of that system here . NPR 's latest financial statements and annual reports are included here too . Learn more about NPR revenues and expenses ↓ Learn more about Member Station revenues ↓ NPR Revenues NPR is an independent , non-profit media organization . We are also a membership organization of separately licensed and operated public radio stations across the United States . NPR 's two largest revenue sources are corporate sponsorships and fees paid by NPR Member organizations to support a suite of programs , tools , and services . Other sources of revenue include institutional grants , individual contributions and fees paid by users of the Public Radio Satellite System ( PRSS ; i.e . Satellite interconnection and distribution ) . NPR 's average consolidated revenues from changes in net assets without donor restrictions ( FY18-FY22 ) NPR Fees from NPR Member organizations NPR 's Member organizations support NPR financially in two ways : A core fee for the NPR newsmagazines ( Morning Edition , All Things Considered , Weekend Edition ) , as well as an array of digital content , tools and platforms , and a suite of services designed to drive audience engagement and support License fees for a portfolio of broadcast programs other than the NPR newsmagazines The core fee calculation is based on a percentage of stations ' membership revenue , as a reflection of the value that NPR programs and services provide to Members and their audiences . The license fees for individual news/talk , entertainment , and music programs ( e.g . programs like Fresh Air , Here & Now , 1A World Cafe , or Throughline ) are set using pricing tiers based on each Member 's total revenue . The fee model includes provisions that recognize NPR Members with particular characteristics that contribute to NPR 's audience service mission , including Members designated by CPB as serving rural and minority audiences . Corporate Sponsorship Support Covering the news requires significant resources . The funds NPR receives from corporate donors are an important part of the revenues that fuel NPR 's in-depth reporting and programming , but only a part . One of the largest portions of NPR 's revenue comes from dues and fees paid by our Member Stations . Corporate sponsors can not influence NPR 's coverage . NPR journalists have no role in selecting corporate sponsors . Our journalists are trained in the ethics and practices of journalism which prevent outside groups from influencing their objectivity , story selection , and reporting . You can read the code of ethics in place at NPR here . When news warrants , we will report on the activities of companies that support NPR . Messages acknowledging NPR 's national sponsors are presented on air in short announcements , and are presented in visual and audio form on NPR.org and other digital services . NPR makes decisions about national corporate sponsors based on principles established by NPR 's Board of Directors . Under those principles , NPR has no list of sources from which funding will be refused . However , potential conflict of interest or similar concerns are considered in accepting or rejecting support from particular entities . This approach results in a diverse pool of funders which is an important basis of NPR 's impartiality as a news organization . To impose a litmus test to accept or reject funding from an organization would create the appearance that NPR as a news organization has taken a position on the issues related to that organization . NPR is represented by National Public Media LLC ( NPM ) , a majority-owned subsidiary of NPR Asset Holding Company , Inc. , a wholly-owned subsidiary of NPR . NPM also handles some corporate sponsorship for NPR and PBS . As noted above , NPR journalists have no role in selecting corporate sponsors . You can find more about National Public Media on the web here . Grants and Contributions Grants from institutions and non-profits have made it possible for NPR to maintain its current programming , and launch new programs and initiatives . They have also allowed us to expand coverage of major news topics including international news , education , science , the environment , and the economy . Many of these grants also directly and indirectly benefit Member Stations . NPR and our Member stations share a common mission and many of the same strategic goals . Together , we are increasingly engaging philanthropic partners at high levels . These individuals and families are interested in supporting""]","[""NPR (National Public Radio) is a non-profit, independent media organization funded through different, but interrelated financial means. Its two main sources of revenue are corporate sponsorships and fees from NPR Member stations for services, tools, and programs. Member stations can contribute financially through a core fee for NPR newsmagazines and platforms, and license fees for other broadcast programs. Additional revenue comes from grants, individual contributions, and fees from users of the Public Radio Satellite System. Corporate sponsorships are an important aspect of the organization's revenue but do not compromise its self-governance or journalistic objectivity. Grants from institutions and non-profits have helped NPR maintain its programming and expand its coverage on various news topics. NPR and its Member stations also engage philanthropic partnerships to support their shared mission.\n""]"

If it 's $ 1000 each year , the fund could be $ 49,000 by the end of the period.For families receiving Family Tax Benefit A , the government will automatically contribute $ 200 a year to the fund without parents having to contribute.If parents want to put more money in after the child turns 18 , the government wo n't put any funds in after that.The child will only be able to withdraw the funds when they turn 18 , and only for two purposes : housing — for example , to buy a home — or education — such as textbooks or learning materials.Claiming to be the underdog in the poll , Mr Perrottet said it was his party 's responsible financial and economic management that would `` keep NSW moving forward '' . `` I know that every single parent here today and across the state shares one thing in common and that is that from the moment our children are born we worry about them and would do anything to ensure that they have a better opportunity than we have , '' he said.What else did the NSW Liberals promise ?

The 1862 Mouse Killer. Mousetrap Monday Short"" on YouTube is an informative and interesting video dissecting and demonstrating an antique mouse trap. The mouse trap discussed is a unique one known as a ""Cannon Mouse Trap"" from the year 1862. The host of the video carefully examines this antique pest control device, explaining the intricate mechanics behind it, which interestingly includes a mini cannon as a part of the trap. Demonstrations are conducted to show viewers how it works.\n\nTo bait the mouse, food is placed in a pan which is attached to a more complex triggering mechanism. When the mouse attempts to take the bait, its action releases a small hammer which strikes a firing cap, causing the cannon to release a loud noise and thereby kill or scare the mouse away. It’s important to note that the video does not show any real mice being harmed. The creator uses a dummy setup to illustrate how the trap would work, and how effective it was considered back in its time.\n\nA large emphasis is put on safety during these demonstrations, underlining that pest control, particularly with such historical devices, can be dangerous if not done properly. This video stands as both an intriguing historical deep-dive into pest control methods, and an entertaining viewing for people interested in antiques and unique contraptions. The conclusion of the video is a call to subscribe and tune in for more interesting trap demonstrations and discussions.']"

Participants often play both submissive and dominant roles for a balanced power play, making pup play appealing and empowering to many. For those interested in exploring pup play, resources such as online forums, websites and clubs are available. The community also hosts events featuring non-sexual activities such as wrestling and running. To enhance the experience, various accessories, like sex gear and puppy play outfits, are widely available in physical and online stores. One defining characteristic of pup play is its lack of set rules, making the way it is practiced largely dependent on personal preference. The term ""pup"" as used in this context should not be confused with its general meanings as a countable noun referring to a young animal or its derogatory colloquial use referring to a cowardly individual. As a precautionary note, potential users should be aware of avoiding potentially unwanted programs (also abbreviated as PUPs) by ensuring computer and software updates and avoiding dubious downloads.', 'The FOLSOM Europe e.V. website announces the program for the 2023 FOLSOM Europe event, a leather and fetish festival.

The author implores readers to examine a thread, presumably containing alternative sources of information, images, or firsthand accounts, with a bid to change their views on the conflict.

The Maui News / MATTHEW THAYER photosA historic South Pacific swell brought high surf and rough ocean conditions over the weekend , leaving beachfront roadways and properties flooded with water and rubble . Warnings by the National Weather Service remained in effect all weekend after predictions that the swell would produce “ dangerous breaking waves along south facing shores , ” with surf reaching up to 24 feet and then subsiding to 15 to 20 feet through 6 p.m. Monday . “ A combination of large surf and regular predicted water levels could lead to flooding of beaches that typically remain dry , especially at and around the peak daily tide , ” according to the weather service . “ Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping across portions of beaches , very strong breaking waves , and strong long shore and rip currents . Large breaking waves and strong currents may impact harbor entrances and channels causing challenging boat handling. ” Rainfall had also been in the forecast as Tropical Storm Darby passed south of the islands over the weekend . However , the weather service showed minimal rainfall for Maui as remnants of the storm dissipated around 5 p.m. Saturday night , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . NOAA ’ s Central Pacific Hurricane Center said that the maximum sustained winds were at 40 miles per hour at the center as the storm moved west at about 22 mph . A surfer pops out of a tube during a long ride at Maalaea ’ s famed Freight Trains surf break Sunday morning . Considered by many as the fastest rideable wave in the world , but rare in occurrence , Freight Trains drew a small army of wave riders and spectators Saturday and Sunday as a large swell hammered Maui ’ s south shore.As the NWS predicted , there was significant beach run-up , flooding of beaches that typically remain dry and exposure of vulnerable coastal roadways on Saturday and Sunday as the south swell reached the islands . Mala Ocean Tavern staff spent their Sunday clearing debris and drying floors after waves crashed into the oceanfront restaurant , according to a post on Instagram . A spokesperson for the Lahaina business could not be immediately reached Sunday , but the post said that they closed “ due to the swell that affected us yesterday and that we are anticipating for today. ” “ Please send all your prayers and aloha for all the oceanfront businesses in Maui today , ” the post added . Down the street , Star Noodle in Lahaina closed for a few hours Saturday due to large surf and ocean conditions fronting the restaurant around 5 p.m. when water started to wash over the break wall , said restaurant Manager Reed Robertson on Sunday afternoon . Kihei Canoe Club members are assisted by volunteers as they wade through seawater to move canoes to a spot safe from waves across South Kihei Road on Saturday. “ It started washing rocks into our parking lot and basically turning our parking lot into a lake , ” Robertson said . “ Some of the water got in the restaurant last night , but that was all cleaned up last night and they put up barricades and we were able to keep from damaging the restaurant. ” Water from the Honu Oceanside seafood restaurant parking lot was also draining into Star Noodle ’ s property and down Front Street , he said . Frida ’ s Beach House , which has an oceanfront seating area , had a similar experience . Among the four businesses located right above the shore on the Mala Warf side of Front Street , Robertson said Star Noodle was the “ least impacted. ” Star Noodle ’ s maintenance team came in at 5 a.m. Sunday to shovel and clear the lot , and doors were open again for business that afternoon , though another swell was anticipated Sunday evening . “ As of now everything is normal operations , ” Robertson said . A surfer takes a spill at Freight Trains in Maalaea SundayFurther west in Kaanapali , Hyatt Regency Maui Resort crew members were spotted digging a channel to drain seawater back to the ocean Sunday morning after Saturday ’ s swell filled portions of hotel grounds . In North Kihei , president of Maui Canoe Club Jeff Moore was seen Saturday with a crew of six members from MCC and Mana ’ olana ( Pink Paddlers ) quickly moving canoes mauka towards the road “ as far as we could ” to save them from the crashing waves and high tide . “ Most of the canoes were also filled with water to further weigh them down , ” Moore said Sunday .

The large waves can make it dangerous to head to the beach or sail on the ocean and can also lead to coastal flooding in low-lying areas.Coastal flooding was evident at the Keauhou Kona Surf & Racquet Club in Kailua-Kona , Hawaii , where video shot Saturday showed torrents of water crashing over the tops of seaside condos , flooding the nearby streets as passersby gawked at the sight.According to Hawaii News Now , several condos were damaged by the waves , including the residence of Isabella Sloan , who filmed the gargantuan waves . `` My condo was hit the first time and flooded everything . Condos down the way from mine were completely wiped out and damaged really badly . Thankfully , everyone is safe , '' Sloan said.Local guests at this wedding have told me they were n't expecting it to be this bad and the backwash on Ali ' i Drive was crazy . Other local guests also wanted people to know that the wedding was still beautiful . No one was hurt .

A series of large waves tore through the venue , but no one was injured.According to Hawaii News Now , the waves also took out one of the bars set up at the wedding site , but somehow spared the happy couple 's wedding cake and their other food . `` We did n't think that [ the waves were ] ever going to get over the wall , '' groom Dillion Murphy said.The large waves impacting Hawaii 's southern shores were generated by Tropical Rainstorm Darby , which passed well to the south of Hawaii . The storm weakened into a tropical storm and then a rainstorm over cooler waters of the Central Pacific after it had peaked as Category 4 hurricane over the East Pacific . Still , the storm was able to churn up the seas , spawning dangerous waves on the southern shores of Hawaii.GET THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP • Have the app ?

Warnings from the National Weather Service about high surf and extreme sea conditions were in effect over the weekend due to predictions that the swell could create dangerous breaking waves along south-facing shores. Maui was expected to have minimal rainfall as remains of the Tropical Storm Darby passed to the south over the weekend. The impacts of the swell included beach run-up, beach floodings, and vulnerability of coastal roadways. Mala Ocean Tavern and Star Noodle were among the businesses impacted by the swell incidents, having to clear debris and control inundation in their premises. Severe inundation was also felt in Kihei and North Kihei, where members of canoe clubs had to swiftly move their canoes to save them from the crashing waves and high tide.', 'Massive two-story waves striking the southern coast of Hawaii over the weekend have caused widespread chaos and damage. Triggered by historic south swells, the waves have disrupted events, including a wedding, and broken over two-story apartments. According to the National Weather Service, waves could reach heights of 15 to 22 feet, leading to potential danger at beaches and sailing on the ocean, as well as causing coastal flooding. Footage from Keauhou Kona Surf & Racquet Club in Kailua-Kona showed heavy flooding in the surrounding area, leading to evacuations. Some condos were fully destroyed by the waves. The waves were generated by Tropical Rainstorm Darby, which passed south of Hawaii.']"

From IV drips and detoxes to superfoods After prostate cancer treatment , a new standard of care for rising PSA Chronic fatigue syndrome is rising / Mind & Mood Cognitive effects in midlife of long-term cannabis use June 14 , 2022 By Kevin Hill , MD , MHS , Contributor , and Michael Hsu , MD , Guest Contributor As of June 2022 , 37 US states have passed medical cannabis laws and 19 states have legalized recreational cannabis . Cannabis has proven beneficial for a range of conditions such as childhood seizure disorders , nausea , vomiting , and loss of appetite in people with HIV/AIDs . In the meantime , a new generation of cannabis products has exploded onto the scene , driven by marketing that fuels a multibillion-dollar industry . The average content of THC ( tetra-9-tetrahydrocannabinol , the psychoactive and potentially addictive chemical in cannabis ) in smoked whole-plant products has risen from 1 % to 4 % in the 1970s to 15 % to 30 % from today 's cannabis dispensaries . Edibles and vapes may contain even higher concentrations of THC . While public perception that cannabis is a harmless substance is growing , the long-term benefits and risks of cannabis use remain unclear . However , one consistent pattern of research has emerged : heavy long-term cannabis use can impact midlife cognition . New research on cannabis use and cognition in midlife Recent research published in The American Journal of Psychiatry closely followed nearly 1,000 individuals in New Zealand from age 3 to age 45 to understand the impact of cannabis use on brain function . The research team discovered that individuals who used cannabis long-term ( for several years or more ) and heavily ( at least weekly , though a majority in their study used more than four times a week ) exhibited impairments across several domains of cognition . Long-term cannabis users ' IQs declined by 5.5 points on average from childhood , and there were deficits in learning and processing speed compared to people that did not use cannabis . The more frequently an individual used cannabis , the greater the resulting cognitive impairment , suggesting a potential causative link . The study also found that people who knew these long-term cannabis users well observed that they had developed memory and attention problems . The above findings persisted even when the study authors controlled for factors such as dependence on other drugs , childhood socioeconomic status , or baseline childhood intelligence . The impact of cannabis on cognitive impairment was greater than that of alcohol or tobacco use . Long-term cannabis users also had smaller hippocampi ( the region of the brain responsible for learning and memory ) . Interestingly , individuals who used cannabis less than once a week with no history of developing dependence did not have cannabis-related cognitive deficits . This suggests there is a range of recreational use that may not lead to long-term cognitive issues . More studies are needed on cannabis use and brain health The new research is just one of several studies suggesting there is a link between long-term heavy cannabis use and cognition . Still , future studies are needed to establish causation and explore how long-term cannabis use might impact the risk of developing dementia , since midlife cognitive impairment is associated with higher rates of dementia . What should you do if you experience cognitive effects of cannabis ? Some people who consume cannabis long-term may develop brain fog , lowered motivation , difficulty with learning , or difficulty with attention . Symptoms are typically reversible , though using products with higher THC content may increase risk of developing cognitive symptoms . Consider the following if you are experiencing cannabis-related cognitive symptoms : Try a slow taper . Gradually decrease the potency ( THC content ) of cannabis you use or how frequently you use it over several weeks , especially if you have a history of cannabis withdrawal . Work with your doctor . Be open with your doctor about your cognitive symptoms , as other medical or psychiatric factors may be at play . Your doctor can also help you navigate a cannabis taper safely , and potentially more comfortably , using other supportive means . Unfortunately , most patients are not comfortable talking with their doctors about cannabis use . Give it time . It may take up to a month before you experience improvements after reducing your dose , as cannabis can remain in the body for two to four weeks . Try objective cognitive tracking . Using an app or objective test such as the mini-mental status exam to track your brain function may be more accurate than self-observation . Your mental health provider may be able to assist with administering intermittent cognitive assessments . Consider alternative strategies . Brain function is not static , like eye color or the number of toes on our feet . Aerobic exercise and engaging in mindfulness , meditation , and psychotherapy may improve long-term cognition .

でも指示に従ったら犯罪に加担させられたケースも DLIS・柳谷 智宣2022年10月7日 11:50 Twitterなどで「お金配り」と称して活動するアカウントを見たことがないでしょうか。そうしたアカウントでは応募する場合の条件として、アカウントをフォローしたり、リツイートで拡散するように呼び掛けていることがあります。詐欺師はこうしたSNS上でのお金配りを悪用して詐欺を仕掛けることがあります。 例えば、過去記事「元ZOZO前澤氏の『お金配り』に参加したつもりが……Facebookで起こっている詐欺に注意」や「ZOZOの社長から100万円振り込むので手数料を振り込むようにDMが来た」で紹介したように、「100万円が当選した」などとという偽の当選通知から、有料の動画配信サイトに登録させたり、手数料を要求する「当選詐欺」が起きており、筆者の所属するDLIS（デジタルリテラシー向上機構）にも今年に入ってからは減少したものの、これまで多くの相談が寄せられていました。 お金配りに絡む詐欺は色々なパターンがあり、注意深い人でもころっと騙されてしまうことがあります。今回は、当選通知後に実際にお金が振り込まれるケースになりますが、そこでやり取りするお金をめぐってトラブルに巻き込まれる事例について紹介します。 「当選者」の口座が別の詐欺の振り込み先として利用されることも まず、詐欺師はSNSでお金配りを告知し、応募してきた人に「当選金を振り込むので、口座番号や個人情報を教えてくれ」などと連絡します。その後、実際に数万円のお金を振り込みます。「当選者」とされた人は喜びますし、詐欺師を信用してしまうでしょう。 一方、詐欺師は他の人にもネット詐欺を仕掛けます。オレオレ詐欺やショッピング詐欺、ロマンス詐欺で被害者にお金を振り込ませるのですが、この振り込み先をお金配りの「当選者」の口座に指定するのです。 当選通知が来て、手数料なども求められていないので、本物だ！と喜んでしまうことでしょう。画面は筆者が再現したものになります 例えば、別のネット詐欺の被害者から同口座へ100万円が振り込まれた後、詐欺師は「当選者」にもう一度連絡し、「間違えて振り込んでしまったので返金してもらえないか」と言います。その際に「手数料として10万円をあげるので手渡しでできないか」と持ち掛けるのです。一度当選し、実際に振り込まれたことがあって信頼しているため、「当選者」は話に乗ってしまいやすい状況です。 手数料を引いた90万円を詐欺師に渡すことで、「当選」者は最初の当選金数万円と10万円の手数料が手元に残るわけですが、実際は犯罪に加担させられたことになるのです。 これは「マネーミュール」という手口で、詐欺師が犯罪で得たお金をマネーロンダリングするときに使います。犯罪収益の運び屋として、犯罪に加担させる詐欺手口です。過去記事「善意とお金欲しさの欲望につけ込む『コロナ・マネーミュール』の手口」でも詳しい手口を紹介しています。 詐欺師自身でだまし取ったお金を口座から引き出したりしていないため、警察に捕まる可能性を減らすことができるのです。そして、警察が詐欺事件の捜査上で突き止めるのは、お金配りに応募したことで結果的に別の詐欺被害者の送金先として利用されてしまった「当選者」の口座です。 詐欺師を信用し、言われるがままに口座に振り込まれたお金をおろして詐欺師に渡した「当選者」は、当人の心情としては被害者でしょう。しかし、警察にはそうはみなされません。ネット詐欺行為にがっつりと加担していると見なされ、逮捕されてしまう可能性があるのです。 マネーミュールについて警視庁生活安全部サイバー犯罪対策課が注意を呼び掛けています 従来は、海外送金を指定されるケースが多かったのですが、最近ではこうした資金移動を日本国内で完結させるケースも観測されています。SNSでのお金配りに応募する際は、そのアカウントが本当に信用できるか確認する必要があります。その上で、多額の現金を動かす、ということが犯罪収益の運び屋になる可能性がある、ということも覚えておきましょう。 あなたの両親も “ ネット詐欺 ” の餌食になっているかもしれません――その最新の手口を広く知ってもらうことで高齢者のデジタルリテラシー向上を図り、ネット詐欺被害の撲滅を目指しましょう。この連載では、「DLIS（デジタルリテラシー向上機構）」に寄せられた情報をもとに、ネット詐欺の被害事例を紹介。対処方法なども解説していきます。 「被害事例に学ぶ、高齢者のためのデジタルリテラシー」の注目記事日本国内で “ 億単位 ” の投資詐欺被害が続出！ 「儲かる」という謳い文句でだまされたり、ロマンス詐欺を仕掛けられるケースもみちょぱ、団長安田、ゴリけん…タレントが相次いで詐欺被害を告白、その手口とはシェアする前にひと呼吸！ ガザ地区で子どもを抱えて避難する男性のフェイク画像が拡散これはだまされる？ 「Dropbox」を悪用したビジネスメール詐欺の手口が巧妙高齢者をターゲットにした「幻のハッカー詐欺」が登場ネットを見ていたら突然「ウイルス感染」警告、誘導先のアプリをインストールしてみると……元ZOZO前澤氏の「お金配り」に参加したつもりが……Facebookで起こっている詐欺に注意iPhoneのカレンダーから「セキュリティ警告」？ 身に覚えのないイベントが勝手に追加されていた友だちから「写真がネットに載ってるじゃん、気まずいな！」と連絡が来た2回目の「特別定額給付金」が支給される？ うっかり騙されて個人情報を入力してしまった「500万円」クラスの高級車の当選メールが届いたので開いてみた「総額450万円」の書留郵便物を受け取るよう郵便局から連絡が来たクレジットカードが届くのを待っていたら、いつの間にか不正利用された「ETCサービス利用照会サービス」のアカウントが停止したのでメールの指示に従ってみたTwitterの怪しいトレンド便乗詐欺、「稼げるかも」と思って連絡したら大変なことに……マッチングアプリで知り合った外国人を信用したら1000万円以上を失ったそのほかの詐欺事例など、この連載の記事一覧はこちらNPO法人DLIS（デジタルリテラシー向上機構） 高齢者のデジタルリテラシー向上を支援するNPO法人です。媒体への寄稿をはじめ高齢者向けの施設や団体への情報提供、講演などを行っています。もし活動に興味を持っていただけたり、協力していただけそうな方は、「dlisjapan @ gmail.com」までご連絡いただければ、最新情報をお送りするようにします。 ※ネット詐欺に関する問い合わせが増えています。万が一ネット詐欺に遭ってしまった場合、まずは以下の記事を参考に対処してください 参考：ネット詐欺の被害に遭ってしまったときにやること、やってはいけないこと▲コロナ禍で通報増加、悪質なショッピングサイトの被害。コピー品が出回り正規メーカーに苦情が殺到するケースも怪しいウェブサイトの危険性ってどう判断すればいい…？ 無料で検証してくれるサービスを使ってみた▲［被害事例に学ぶ、高齢者のためのデジタルリテラシー］の他の記事を見る関連リンク 悪質なショッピングサイト等に関する統計情報 2022年上半期（JC3） 「富士山グラス」の詐欺サイトに関する重要なお知らせ（田島硝子） 関連記事連載被害事例に学ぶ、高齢者のためのデジタルリテラシーそれってネット詐欺ですよ！ 騙しの手口まとめ【解説記事一覧】2019年8月16日連載被害事例に学ぶ、高齢者のためのデジタルリテラシー手に入りづらい商品が激安で売られている？ 賀来賢人さんも引っ掛かったネット通販の「ショッピング詐欺」2021年4月16日連載被害事例に学ぶ、高齢者のためのデジタルリテラシー元モーニング娘。の保田圭さん、子どものヴァイオリン購入でネット詐欺に遭ってしまう2022年8月26日連載被害事例に学ぶ、高齢者のためのデジタルリテラシー電動自転車が「9割引」で激安販売 ! ?

% 程度上昇した。【関連記事】・マスク氏、TwitterのCEO退任表明 ユーザー投票結果受け・Twitterに通話機能 ビデオチャットも、マスク氏表明・米テスラ純利益24 % 減 1〜3月、値下げで3年ぶり減益多様な観点からニュースを考える※掲載される投稿は投稿者個人の見解であり、日本経済新聞社の見解ではありません。この投稿は現在非表示に設定されています_ ( _更新 )

According""]","[""Flag desecration is the act of destroying, damaging or mutilating a flag in public intentionally, often for political protests or insults. Many countries have laws that restrict the methods of destruction or specific uses of their national flag, aiming to prevent desecration. Some countries also extend these laws to prohibit desecration of flags of other nations. Behavior considered desecration can include burning, defacing, stepping on, or insulting the flag, among other things.\n\nThe reasons for flag desecration vary and can include protests against a country's foreign policies, its government or as an insult to the people of the nation represented by the flag. It can also be a protest against the flag desecration laws themselves. In some countries, desecrating a flag can result in penalties such as imprisonment or a fine. These penalties can vary significantly from one country to another. For example, in Algeria, flag desecration results in 5-10 years imprisonment, whereas countries like Austria, Belgium have imprisonment and fine penalties, whereas countries like Australia, Canada have no penalties.""]"

See our ethics statement . Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeApple may be cracking down on apps that no longer receive updates . In a screenshotted email sent to affected developers , titled “ App Improvement Notice , ” Apple warns it will remove apps from the App Store that haven ’ t been “ updated in a significant amount of time ” and gives developers just 30 days to update them. “ You can keep this app available for new users to discover and download from the App Store by submitting an update for review in 30 days , ” Apple writes in the email . “ If no update is submitted in 30 days , the app will be removed from sale. ” While Apple will remove the outdated apps from the App Store , any previously downloaded apps will remain on users ’ devices.A number of app makers , like Protopop Games developer Robert Kabwe , have expressed their concerns about the change . Kabwe says on Twitter that Apple is threatening to remove his fully-functional game , Motivoto , because it hasn ’ t been updated since March 2019.Meanwhile , Kosta Eleftheriou , the developer of the FlickType Apple Watch keyboard , says Apple took down a version of his app made specifically for the visually impaired because it has n't been updated in two years . As Eleftheriou points out in his tweet , the once-super-popular Pocket God app still remains on the App Store even though it received its last update in 2015 . Developer Emilia Lazer-Walker also reported that Apple is removing “ a few ” of her older games from the App Store . Several other developers share the same experience , noting that they just haven ’ t had the time to update their apps.On Apple ’ s App Store Improvements page , the company says : “ We are implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps , removing apps that no longer function as intended , don ’ t follow current review guidelines , or are outdated. ” There isn ’ t a time stamp on the page , so it ’ s not immediately clear when Apple published or last updated the post . Apple did n't immediately respond to The Verge ’ s request for comment.In 2016 , Apple said it would start removing abandoned apps from the App Store . At the time , it also warned developers that they would have 30 days to update their app before it got taken down . That said , it ’ s unclear whether Apple has continuously been enforcing this rule over the years , or if it recently started conducting a wider sweep . Apple also doesn ’ t clearly outline what it considers to be “ outdated ” — whether it 's based on the time that has elapsed since an app was last updated , or if it concerns compatibility with the most recent version of iOS.Critics of this policy argue that mobile apps should remain available no matter their age , much like old video games remain playable on consoles . Others say the policy is unnecessarily tough on developers , and claim Apple doesn ’ t fully respect the work that goes into indie games.Earlier this month , the Google Play Store similarly announced it would begin limiting the visibility of apps that “ don ’ t target an API level within two years of the latest major Android release version. ” Android developers have until November 1st , 2022 to update their apps , but also have the option of applying for a six-month extension if they can ’ t make the deadline . With both major app stores cracking down on older apps , this could leave some developers , especially indie studios , struggling to keep up.CommentsMost PopularRabbit sells out 10,000 units of its R1 pocket AI companion in one dayThe Rabbit R1 is an AI-powered gadget that can use your apps for youGoogle confirms it just laid off around a thousand employeesCES 2024 : all the TVs , laptops , smart home gear , and more from the show floorHonda debuts new global EV series , Honda Zero , coming in 2026Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we 've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email ( required ) Sign upBy submitting your email , you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice .

Over the years , the apps on the App Store have fluctuated marginally , but the recent quarter highlights an accelerated drop in apps . In particular , according to data acquired by Finbold , the number of apps in the Apple App Store hit a seven-year low during 2022 Q3 to stand at 1,642,759 . The value represents a drop of 541,697 or 24.79 % from the 2,184,456 registered during Q2 2022 . The last time the number of apps was this low was during Q3 2015 at 1,672,271 . Elsewhere , regarding the number of apps on leading app stores globally as of Q3 2022 , Google Play Store ranks top at 3,553,050 while App Store ranks second at 1,642,759 . Amazon ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) Appstore has the third highest number of applications at 483,328 . Policy changes trigger a drop in App Store apps It is worth noting that removing apps from the App Store is a perennial practice initiated by Apple as part of maintaining quality on the platform . However , the recent spike in removed apps can be attributed to several decisions by the company to improve user experience . In this case , in April 2022 , the company notified developers that it was rolling out a plan to remove old apps that had not been updated for some time . The directive saw developers directed to make updates within 30 days or risk removal from the platform . Previously , Apple had not set any timeline for removing apps , but the recent update stressed that cleaning the App Store is an ongoing process and will evaluate apps , removing apps that no longer function as planned , don ’ t adhere to reviewed guidelines , or need to be updated . Notably , the policy has received a lot of criticism , with developers arguing that the old apps should continue to exist on the platform as long as they are still functional . For instance , gaming developers maintain that the apps should be treated as old video games that remain playable on consoles . At the same time , in recent months , the App Store has become a center of controversy with reported scams and fraudulent applications existing on the platform . In this case , the company resorted to removing virus-scanning apps , app clones , and other low-quality apps cluttering the App Store , with Apple maintaining that the App Store offers a safe experience for users . Overall , removing apps aligns with Apple ’ s long-standing policy of curating the App Store to eliminate apps that routinely fail to adhere to set standards . App Store drop in revenue Interestingly , the drop in the number of apps has also correlated with a period in which the App Store registered one of the significant declines in revenues during 2022 Q3 . Notably , the revenue plunge was also witnessed from the gaming apps that are crucial to the store ’ s financial performance . In the meantime , Apple continues to explore the App Store as a possible strategic source of revenue through some decisions that have been deemed unpopular , like increasing app purchases , in-app purchases , and subscriptions from the App Store . Elsewhere , the App Store trails the Google Play Store in the number of applications driven by factors like a larger Android market than iOS devices . Also , developing Android apps is cheaper since developers do not need significant resources . At the same time , approval for publishing apps on the Play Store is less cumbersome . App Store future outlook At the same time , the outlook of the App Store is likely to be impacted in the future , especially with regulators increasingly cracking down on the company ’ s market dominance . This is highlighted by a recent European antitrust law that aims to allow users to install software applications from third parties . In general , the number of apps removed from the App Store will likely increase , especially with the company targeting specific sectors . For instance , Apple recently clarified its rules for apps affecting cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) . For crypto exchanges , Apple ’ s policy indicates that the apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on a regulated exchange . However , such apps can only be offered in regions with licensing and permission to operate a business .

The email stated that these are apps that have not been updated in a significant amount of time, and it gives developers just 30 days to update them. Failure to do so will result in the app being removed from the App Store, although already downloaded apps will remain on users\' devices. Some developers have expressed concern about this movement, including those whose apps are still fully functional. Apple\'s App Store Improvements page says that they are removing apps that no longer function as intended, do not follow current review guidelines, or are outdated, though it doesn\'t specify what it means by ""outdated."" Critics argue that this is a severe policy that doesn\'t fully respect the work related to indie games.\n', ""Over 540,000 apps were removed from the Apple App Store in Q3 2022, marking the lowest number of apps in seven years. The total number of apps fell to 1,642,759, a decrease of 24.79% from the previous quarter. This has reportedly been due to Apple's policy changes, with the company striving to remove outdated and low-quality apps to enhance user experience. These measures have faced criticism from developers, especially in the gaming industry. Additionally, the revenue of the App Store also saw a significant drop during the same period. Apps allowing transactions of cryptocurrency are permitted only in regions where the operator is licensed and has obtained necessary permissions.\n""]"

Kieran Pender from the Human Rights Law Centre ( HRLC ) said the decision showed that the law was “ utterly broken ” .Boyle accused the Australian Taxation Office of aggressively pursuing debts from taxpayers and had fought to be protected from prosecution under the PID Act.Are Australia ’ s whistleblowing laws fit for purpose ? A former tax officer ’ s hearing may tell us Read moreKudelka said she found Boyle was “ not protected ” by the laws and dismissed his claim , meaning he will face a jury trial in October.The reasons for her decision were put under an interim suppression order on the request of commonwealth prosecutors.Boyle ’ s advocates , including the HRLC , have called on the federal government to drop the charges , as it did with those against Witness K ’ s lawyer , Bernard Collaery.The HRLC warned that if Boyle was found not to be immune to prosecution , it would have a chilling effect on other would-be whistleblowers . Sign up for Guardian Australia ’ s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Pender said the decision was a “ major blow for Australian democracy ” . “ Whistleblowers should be protected , not prosecuted – and the PID Act was enacted to ensure just that , ” he said. “ The court ’ s decision that Boyle ’ s whistleblowing on wrongdoing within the ATO was not covered by the PID Act shows that the law is utterly broken. ” When he was an ATO employee , Boyle grew increasingly concerned about the office ’ s aggressive debt collection tactics.The Adelaide man tried to report his concerns internally , then to the inspector general of taxation . Nothing happened , so eventually he went public and appeared on the ABC ’ s Four Corners program to tell his story.The charges against him – which he says came from when he was trying to collect evidence – included taping private conversations without consent and taking photos of taxpayer information.Boyle sought protection under the PID Act after he went public . He was hoping to be granted immunity from prosecution over the 24 charges against him because they were part of the process of making a public interest disclosure.The independent MP Andrew Wilkie said Monday ’ s ruling again showed the deficiencies in the PID Act . He said the government , which is intending to reform the act , should intervene to stop the prosecution until its review of the legislation is completed. “ Mr Boyle would never have been in this position if we had strong whistleblower protections in place , ” Wilkie said. “ Whistleblowers are vital to a healthy democracy and should be protected not punished . This case reveals the urgent need for reform , including the creation of a whistleblower protection authority that covers both the public and private sectors. ” Former senator Rex Patrick , who advocated for Boyle when he was in office , said it was “ hugely disappointing ” for Boyle and for whistleblower protection in general.The attorney general , Mark Dreyfus , could intervene at any time , Patrick said. “ He knows federal whistleblower laws are broken and yet he ’ s letting Richard hang out to dry for calling out power abuse inside the ATO , ” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day , telling you what ’ s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice : Newsletters may contain info about charities , online ads , and content funded by outside parties .

The majority of the legal bill relates to the now-abandoned case against Canberra lawyer Bernard Collaery and his client, ""Witness K"", costing the Commonwealth $5.5 million. Collaery was charged with revealing classified information about a secret mission in Timor Leste. Meanwhile, the prosecution of David McBride, accused of leaking classified defence data, cost $1.9 million, and Richard Boyle\'s whistleblowing case about unethical practices within the Australian Taxation Office reached $233,171. The high expenditure was criticised by whistleblowing advocates and has called for a review of whistleblowing protections.\n', 'Former military lawyer David McBride will face trial in November 2023, four years after being accused of leaking information about alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is currently investigating several senior officers over these alleged crimes. McBride faces five charges, including theft and unlawfully giving classified information under the Defence Act. He unsuccessfully sought immunity from prosecution by claiming whistleblower status. The trial could last for three weeks and may be held in secret. It is not clear whether it will be held in secret. Supporters have urged the federal government to cease prosecution.\n', ""Whistleblower Richard Boyle, who accused the Australian Taxation Office of aggressively pursuing taxpayer debts, will face a trial and potential prison term after a judge ruled his actions were not immune to prosecution under the Public Interest Disclosure (PID) Act. The court's dismissal of Boyle's claims to be protected by the PID Act has raised concerns among human rights advocates and other supporters, who argue the decision reveals fundamental flaws in the law relating to whistleblowers and could deter future whistleblowing. Boyle's charges relate to taping private conversations without consent and taking photographs of taxpayer information as part of his evidence gathering.""]"

Updated numbers suggest the ACT is in the midst of an [ Omicron ] XBB.1.5 wave . Our hospitalisations are trending up , with the week-to-week rise being the second fastest since mid-December , '' he wrote . `` Modelling for the week ahead is predicting a sustained increase in weekly case numbers , and an increase in hospitalisations . `` With recent outbreaks in a number of inpatient wards , it 's the right time to be reviewing our settings . `` Blake Proberts , co-owner of the Two Before Ten group . Picture by Keegan CarrollHigher cases of COVID-19 in the community could lead to staff shortages in hospitals , health centres , schools and businesses.Canberra Health Services is being advised on how to `` prepare for an accelerating wave , and the cooler days ahead '' , Mr Peffer wrote . `` We 're working through the details of what any changes might look like - but I 'm foreshadowing the potential for change in the weeks ahead . `` Average daily cases in the ACT rose by 21 per cent in the week beginning March 27 , Australian government data showed.Public schools are also preparing for likely teacher shortages during winter , a letter by ACT Education Directorate director general Katy Haire showed . `` There may be times in the coming months where unexpected staff absences , and the national teacher shortage , will mean that some schools may need to modify their programs , '' the letter said.Blake Proberts , co-owner of the Two Before Ten group . Picture by Keegan CarrollBlake Proberts is co-owner of the Two Before Ten group , which has 12 bars and cafes in the Canberra region . A surge in COVID-19 could `` wipe out '' hospitality staff , he said . `` It 's a little daunting , but because we 've experienced it and we have the procedures and policies in place to handle it , it 's not really that scary , '' Mr Proberts said . `` What worries me more is if there 's a policy change , or if it 's so big that there 's another lockdown and it 's those inconsistencies that COVID creates . `` He said the business prepared for a rise in infections by overstaffing and exposing workers to different venues in case they needed to cover for sick colleagues.Picture suppliedMr Proberts said it was also important staff knew they would not be punished for taking work off while sick , and could make up hours when they came back.Like the rest of Australia , Omicron variants make up most of the COVID cases in the territory , an ACT government spokesperson said . `` XBB recombinant variants accounted for 78 per cent of recent samples sequenced in the ACT , with the XBB.1.5 making up 45 per cent of these , '' they said.XBB.1.5 , also known as Kraken , had a `` slight immune escape advantage '' , genomics expert Dr Ash Porter said.This meant it was harder for the human body to resist the virus.All respiratory illnesses spread more in colder months , Dr Porter said . `` People spend more time indoors breathing on each other and less time outdoors , where there 's less infectious particles , '' Dr Porter said.Having a number of different variants in the community could lead to people catching COVID multiple times in a short period of time , Deakin University epidemiologist Professor Catherine Bennett said . `` Immunity from one infection does n't give quite as good a protection from the other [ variant ] in those first few months , '' she said.Canberra is likely to face another COVID surge . Picture by Keegan CarrollPromisingly , the latest uptick in COVID cases looks more like a `` slow rise '' than surge , Dr Bennett said . `` We are seeing a sort of slow rise in cases in ACT and NSW , across the country , '' she said.Indicators of a rise in cases includes hospitalisations , ICU admissions , anti-viral requests and aged care outbreaks.She said states and territories were in different states of outbreaks . `` They 've all gone up slightly but it has n't taken off in the way other surges have , '' Dr Bennett said . `` We might see a change in the variant , but it does n't necessarily translate to a big wave of infections , let alone hospitalisation . `` IN OTHER NEWS : Call for more action to reduce government debtHow Tesla has become the great disrupterWhat 's on""]","['Canberra\'s hospitals, schools, and businesses are preparing for another potential wave of COVID-19 due to a rise in hospitalisations and ward outbreaks.

WaxmanMarch 3 , 2022 4:04 PM ESTIn seven days of fighting , Russia has launched hundreds of missiles into Ukraine , and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported Mar . 3 that about a million refugees have fled the country . The U.N. also reported there have been at least 752 civilian casualties in Ukraine and at least 227 fatalities , as of Mar . 2 . As the war in Ukraine rages , so does a war of words . In a TV address on Feb. 24 , Russian President Vladimir Putin explained that the goal of invading Ukraine was “ to protect the people that are subjected to abuse , genocide from the Kiev regime ” and to “ demilitarize and denazify Ukraine. ” But historians tell TIME that Putin is misusing the term “ denazify , ” pointing out that denazification refers to a particular moment in time in the post-war era , and that Putin ’ s use of the term is propaganda aimed at his fears about the current democratic government in the Ukraine , and is disconnected from the history around the Nazi regime of the 1930s and 1940s . “ There ’ s a very specific historical meaning [ to denazification ] , which is the process undergone in Germany after the Second World War , ” says Timothy Snyder , an expert on Ukraine and author of The Road to Unfreedom : Russia , Europe , America . “ In West Germany , there was a certain amount of attention paid to high Nazi officials , by the Americans , the other occupying powers , and an attempt to remove them from public life…Using it , as Mr. Putin does , out of context , is an attempt to transform the country and the people he ’ s talking about , into Nazi Germany. ” Read more : After World War II , Most ‘ Ordinary Nazis ’ Returned to Lives of Obscurity . “ A Nazi can only be a German , ” he adds . “ So sometimes we throw the words around , but a Nazi is a member of the National Socialist Party in Germany in the 1930s or 1940s . There were certainly efforts in the postwar Soviet Union to find collaborators , but not to find Nazis per se…You can not denazify when there are no Nazis. ” There were many layers to denazification . As Jason Stanley , Yale University professor and author of \u200b\u200bHow Fascism Works : The Politics of Us and Them explains , “ Denazification was the process the Allies took to Germany . Beginning with the Nuremberg trials , they tried and convicted a number of Nazis , a number were executed , and then they replaced Nazi ideology in all the major institutions [ with ] people who were untainted by Nazism— or this is what they tried to do . They replaced them with leaders who are loyal to democracy , and they replaced Nazi ideology with democratic practices. ” After the Allies occupied Germany , they did investigate some former members of the Nazi party to make sure they didn ’ t maintain Nazi loyalties . But many slipped through the cracks . “ It was a flawed process used by the Allies occupying Germany that generally applied to the small fry and left the big fish off the hook , ” as Omer Bartov , a Brown University professor and author of Anatomy of a Genocide : The Life and Death of a Town Called Buczacz , puts it . Read more : How American educated the children of Nazis after World War IISo why is Putin using a term from the 1940s and 1950s in 2022 ? The Soviet Union helped the Allies defeat the Nazis . There were more than 20 million casualties , and memory of the fighting still lives on in the region . So using a term like denazification resonates deeply with his domestic audience and is a “ very powerful piece of propaganda , ” says Stanley . “ From the perspective of many of the Russian people , Nazism is something the Germans brought from the West , which resulted in the horrific mass murder of many Soviet citizens , Jewish and non-Jewish…Putin—and he ’ s been doing this for many years—is saying that anything that comes from the west is Nazism. ” About 1.5 million Ukrainian Jews died during the Holocaust . While there were Ukrainians who collaborated with Nazi German occupiers during World War II , the historians TIME talked to stress those instances are contained to that era . “ At one point , there were some Ukrainians who collaborated with Nazis , ” explains Jeffrey Veidlinger , author of In the Shadow of the Shtetl : Small-Town Jewish Life in Soviet Ukraine . “ This is why Putin can use that term , because it has resonance and people are familiar with this history of Ukraine having sympathies with the Nazis , but this was 80 years ago , and isn ’ t reflective of the current Ukrainian Government…It ’ s a meaningless term when Putin uses it . He ’ s not afraid of Nazis in Ukraine . He ’ s afraid of democracy']","['In an article by TIME, historians challenge Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s use of the term ""denazification"" to justify the invasion of Ukraine. They argue that the term specifically refers to the post-World War II process to purge Germany of its Nazi regime, and hence its use by Putin is out of context and acts as a piece of propaganda targeting his domestic audience. The push for ""denazification"" by Putin aims to instill fear about the current democratic government in Ukraine, suggesting it is akin to the Nazi regime of the 1930s and 1940s. While Ukraine had some collaborations with Nazis during World War II, these instances do not mirror the nation\'s current political environment. The historians believe that Putin is not fearful of Nazis in Ukraine, but rather its democracy.']"

( DWAC ) StockTWTRBy : Brian Stewart , SA News Editor97 Comments Scott Olson/Getty Images News A regulatory filing related to a going-public SPAC transaction for Donald Trump 's media company underlined the venture 's dependence on the former president , listing his popularity as a key pillar of its appeal and revealing that outspoken Republican must give the company at least six hours of exclusivity for any post he makes . The information was included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to a merger deal Trump Media & Technology Group has with Digital World Acquisition ( NASDAQ : DWAC ) , a SPAC slated to take Trump 's media company public . The firm includes the former president 's Truth Social platform , meant to offer a MAGA alternative to Twitter ( TWTR ) and other social media offerings . The document detailed that the former president may use other social platforms , but he is obligated to post on Truth Social first . He must then wait at least six hours before using another outlet . `` President Trump is generally obligated to make any social media post on TruthSocial and may not make the same post on another social media site for 6 hours . Thereafter , he is free to post on any site to which he has access , '' the firm stated in the filing . The registration statement also spotlighted the media venture 's reliance on Trump as an attraction for potential users . `` While TMTG believes there is sufficient demand for a true free speech platform , the image , reputation , popularity and talent of its chairman , President Trump , will be important factors to its success , '' the company said . The firm added : `` If President Trump becomes less popular or there are further controversies that damage his credibility or the desire of people to use a platform associated with him , and from which he will derive financial benefit , TMTG ’ s results of operations could be adversely affected . '' DWAC rallied about 9 % on Monday following the filing of the registration statement , a key step towards closing an eventual SPAC deal . The transaction is now expected in the second half of the year . The stock took a step back earlier this month after Elon Musk agreed to purchase Twitter ( TWTR ) . The move came on speculation that the billionaire would allow Trump back on the platform once he took over . Musk has said he would reverse the former president 's ban , which the Tesla boss called a `` morally bad decision , and foolish in the extreme . '' DWAC rebounded late last week as Musk put his deal to acquire TWTR on hold . On Monday , Musk said he could be interested in pushing forward with the transaction at a lower price .

Police are investigating whether a human-driven vehicle may have been involved in the crash . The driver struck a female pedestrian , throwing her in the path of a Cruise robotaxi that was operating autonomously . The Cruise vehicle then braked , with its rear tire still on top of the woman ’ s leg , fire officials told NBC . After Cruise disabled the vehicle , rescuers were able to get the vehicle off the woman ’ s leg using the jaws of life , NBC reports . While the investigation is ongoing , Cruise put out a series of statements on X ( formerly Twitter ) to explain its role in the crash . The pedestrian was “ launched ” in front of a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a vehicle that was traveling in the lane to the left , the company said . The robotaxi “ braked aggressively to minimize impact , ” while the driver of the other vehicle fled the scene . The condition of the struck pedestrian is unknown at this time , police said . The crash was the latest in San Francisco to involve a driverless vehicle , as hundreds more have hit the road recently for 24/7 commercial service . With more robotaxis have also come a number of crashes , most of which have been minor , though a handful have involved injuries . The crash was the latest in San Francisco to involve a driverless vehicleA spokesperson with the San Francisco Police Department sent this statement : On 10/02/23 at approximately 9:31 pm officers responded to 5th and Market Streets regarding a vehicle collision involving a pedestrian . Officers arrived on scene and discovered an autonomous vehicle struck an adult pedestrian . Officers rendered aid and summoned medics to the scene and transported the pedestrian to the hospital . The medical condition of the pedestrian is unknown at this time . The autonomous vehicle remained on scene and did not have an occupant at the time of the collision . The operator of the autonomous vehicle is cooperating with the investigation . We believe that another vehicle that was not an autonomous vehicle may have been initially involved in the collision , but the vehicle or driver were not present at the scene during our investigation . The SFPD Traffic Collision Investigations Unit is leading the investigation and is looking into the factors that lead to this collision . Anyone with information is asked to contact SFPD at 415-575-4444 or text a tip to TIP411 and begin the message with SFPD.At the scene of any vehicle collision , we document what occurred by gathering evidence . This evidence includes the location of the vehicle and/or vehicles before , during and after the collision , which is why the vehicle was kept in its stationary position.According to Cruise , “ a human-driven vehicle struck a pedestrian while traveling in the lane immediately to the left of a Cruise AV . The initial impact was severe and launched the pedestrian directly in front of the AV. ” “ The AV then braked aggressively to minimize the impact , ” the company continued . “ The driver of the other vehicle fled the scene , and at the request of the police the AV was kept in place. ” Cruise says it is “ actively working with police to help identify the responsible driver , ” including sharing video footage from its vehicle ’ s cameras with police , spokesperson Aaron Mclear said in an email . A spokesperson from the San Francisco Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment . The crash incident has yet to be filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles , which requires all AV companies to report collisions . RelatedRobotaxis are driving on thin ice In August , a Cruise robotaxi collided with a fire truck , injuring one passenger . In response , the company reduced the number of vehicles it had deployed by half while the city investigated the incident . City officials , including transit , police , and fire departments , have expressed serious concerns about driverless vehicles intruding on emergency scenes , blocking intersections , and obstructing emergency vehicles .

Le Gorafi Adresse www.legorafi.fr Description Site d'information parodique Slogan « Toute l'information selon des sources contradictoires » Commercial Oui Publicité Oui Type de site Pure player Langue Français Propriétaire DC Company ( depuis 2021 ) Créé par Pablo Mira et Sébastien Liebus [ 1 ] Lancement 2012 État actuel En activité modifier Le Gorafi ( anagramme de « Le Figaro » ) est un site d'information parodique français , créé en mai 2012 durant la campagne présidentielle française sur le modèle de The Onion , journal satirique américain de fausses informations [ 2 ] . Il a aussi été comparé à Infos du Monde [ 3 ] et à L'Examineur [ 4 ] . Jusqu'en 2018 , le site présentait une dimension interactive permettant aux lecteurs de réagir en commentant les articles , comme dans certains sites d'information . Les internautes eux-mêmes agissaient de façon parodique : langage SMS , utilisation inappropriée des majuscules , faux trolls ou militants politiques . L'identité des rédacteurs était inconnue [ 5 ] jusqu'en janvier 2014 , date à laquelle les deux créateurs — Pablo Mira et Sébastien Liebus — se font connaître dans les médias [ 1 ] . Histoire [ modifier | modifier le code ] Premiers pas [ modifier | modifier le code ] Le Gorafi a d'abord été un simple fil Twitter débuté en février 2012 , pendant la campagne présidentielle française , avant d'être transposé sous la forme d'un blog en mai 2012 , puis de subir une refonte en septembre 2012 en devenant un site web [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . Depuis , plusieurs de ses articles ont été relayés dans la presse , notamment celui portant sur un supposé nouveau défi relevé par Felix Baumgartner , qui aurait décidé d'effectuer la traversée en solitaire de l'Île-de-France en RER B [ 2 ] , ou encore celui concernant la démission de l'écharpe de Christophe Barbier , article démenti ensuite de manière humoristique par l'intéressé [ 8 ] . Une institution du web [ modifier | modifier le code ] Le site présente le journal comme datant de 1826 , issu d'une scission après un conflit d'intérêts au sein de la rédaction du Figaro et nommé Gorafi du fait de la dyslexie de son fondateur Jean-René Buissière . Les contenus sont comparés à la « Page Pute » de Brain Magazine , au site humoristique Bilboquet magazine [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , ou à un autre collectif satirique présent sur Twitter et Facebook , l'Humour de droite . Le Gorafi revendiquait plus de 400 000 visiteurs uniques en février 2013 [ 7 ] et dépasse régulièrement les 900 000 visiteurs uniques par mois en juin 2013 d'après Les Inrocks [ 3 ] . En janvier 2014 , L'Année du Gorafi 2013 est publiée aux éditions Denoël [ 11 ] . En novembre 2014 , paraît L'Année du Gorafi 2 . Les auteurs sont invités dans l'émission radio de critique des médias L'Instant M de France Inter , où , durant un quart d'heure , ils se dévoilent [ 12 ] . Le 31 août 2015 , vers 9 heures , Le Gorafi a créé un « faux bad buzz » en affichant une redirection temporaire avec un message « Le Gorafi , c'est fini , merci de votre fidélité [ 13 ] . » Il s'agissait d'un « coup de pub pour sa nouvelle plateforme » [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] . Jusqu'en 2018 , le site du Gorafi permettait aux lecteurs de commenter les articles dans une section nommée « avis éclairés » . Les contributions étaient essentiellement humoristiques ( jeux de mots , reprise ou continuation de l'article ) de façon parfois involontaire lorsque des utilisateurs commentaient sans connaître le caractère satirique du site . Toutefois , ce service n'est plus proposé par le site du Gorafi . En 2021 , face à l'accumulation de scandales et d'erreurs de communication du gouvernement Macron selon le sociologue Frédéric Lordon , ce dernier publie un essai titré Critique de la raison gorafique , dans lequel il déplore que la réalité politique française dépasse petit à petit la satire que tente d'en faire le site [ 16 ] . La même semaine , le site Arrêt sur images titre « Le blues du Gorafi » , affirmant que « Le Gorafi est dépassé par la réalité » , et que l'actualité politique est définitivement devenue « gorafique » [ 17 ] .

México D.F . Sábado 17 de mayo de 2003 El recorrido por el DF sirvió para intercambiar promesas de buscar consensos Destacan Fox y López Obrador diálogo y acuerdo político `` Cuentas con nosotros '' , externó el Ejecutivo federal al jefe de Gobierno capitalino Colaboraremos con el Presidente para defender el interés general , expresó el mandatario local JUAN MANUEL VENEGAS Y ELIA BALTAZAR La presentación de las obras del distribuidor vial de San Antonio y de la remodelación en Paseo de la Reforma , devino en un ejercicio de sobriedad republicana . Sin protagonismos , representados y reconocidos todos los sectores de la sociedad , el presidente Vicente Fox Quesada y el jefe de Gobierno del Distrito Federal , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , realzaron la magnitud de la obra pública , y a la vez se esmeraron en el énfasis por el diálogo y el acuerdo político . `` Al Presidente de México lo consideramos la más elevada autoridad del país , lo respetamos y siempre que se trate de defender el interés general va a contar con nosotros '' , destacó del mensaje improvisado de López Obrador . Atento , Fox dio unos pasos para acercarse al jefe de Gobierno , le dio las gracias por el mensaje , lo saludó -esta vez no para la pose que exigen las cámaras- y le devolvió , también improvisando , palabras de colaboración a la autoridad perredista de la capital del país . `` ¡Cuentas con nosotros ! `` , le dijo , hablándole de tú , a López Obrador . Testigos de las obras y las palabras fueron el premio Nobel de Literatura , Gabriel García Márquez , el rector de la Universidad Nacional , Juan Ramón de la Fuente , el cardenal Norberto Rivera , Emilio Azcárraga , Juan Francisco Ealy Ortiz e Issac Saba ; trabajadores , ciudadanos y funcionarios federales y locales de todos los niveles . Molestia de Fox por acarreados Pero nada de acarreos ni ostentaciones , que es otro hecho a resaltar . No cabían ese tipo de manifestaciones en esta tarde de sobriedad y de ejercicio pleno de la política . Eso lo entendieron casi todos , menos los directivos del PAN de la delegación Miguel Hidalgo , que tuvieron el desatino de enviar a militantes a gritar porras para Fox . Hasta los enviaron con playeras y mandiles azul-naranja del panismo y a distribuir panfletos partidistas . No venía al caso ese intento de provocación . Fox -acostumbrado a saludar , aunque sea de lejos , a sus simpatizantes- ni volteó a verlos , en tanto que Rodolfo Elizondo y Felipe Calderón -los más panistas de entre los asistentes- , con gestos manifestaron su desaprobación . Todo en orden La presentación de la inmensa obra vial , que se construye a 27 metros de altura sobre el Periférico de la ciudad de México ( transitándola desde arriba se alcanza a observar su magnitud ) , ocurrió a las 18 horas de este viernes . Más de un centenar de reporteros de todos los medios de comunicación se dieron cita una hora antes y , en lugares diseñados para observar el pequeño recorrido a pie que hicieron Fox y López Obrador , escucharon la explicación técnica que de la obra hizo la secretaria del Medio Ambiente del Distrito Federal , Claudia Sheinbaum . Todo a distancia . También con mucho orden , los representantes de los medios se dedicaron a observar a los dos gobernantes y sus acompañantes . Y si no hubo intentos ni modo para entrevistas -seguramente parte de la planeación del acto- , lo que sí fue marcada la sorpresa por la presencia del escritor García Márquez . `` ¡Es un lujo que esté por acá ! `` , se escuchó entre todas las voces que remarcaban la presencia del Premio Nobel . `` Es una obra que nos hace sentir orgullosos de esta ciudad ; una ciudad que está creciendo , que en economía se está levantando y que , además , permite resolver un problema de tráfico , de movilidad de ciudadanos y resolver un problema de contaminación atmosférica de la capital '' , subrayó Sheinbaum . Por el orden , en poco tiempo -menos de media hora- Fox fue enterado de los alcances y dimensiones del distribuidor vial . De su importancia para los capitalinos . El mensaje político de Paseo de la Reforma Las comitivas se dirigieron luego a Paseo de la Reforma . El secretario de Obras y Servicios de la ciudad de México , César Buenrostro , y las secretarias de Turismo , federal y local , Leticia Navarro y Julieta Campos , respectivamente , se encargarían de informar a Fox Quesada de los trabajos ya terminados para remodelar y mejorar el paseo turístico y cultural de Reforma . Llegarían los mensajes de López Obrador y Fox Quesada . Su esmero por el diálogo político . Por la inclusión de los sectores sociales y empresariales . `` Toda la obra de gobierno que se realiza en el Distrito Federal se puede concretar porque suma voluntades ; todo lo que hacemos es la suma de voluntades . Participan los trabajadores , los obreros , que son de los más calificados en el mundo . Participan los empresarios , las iglesias , las universidades , los integrantes del mundo de la cultura y del mundo intelectual ; los medios de comunicación , los vecinos , los ciudadanos en general '' , enfatizó el jefe de Gobierno capitalino .

( Image credit : antiquesandthearts.com ) The upcoming movie `` Fright Night '' tells the story of a Las Vegas , Nevada , high school student named Charlie who suspects that his mysterious new neighbor Jerry ( played by Colin Farrell ) is actually a vampire who is preying on his classmates and friends.Charlie wants to slay the vampire but has a problem : He has no experience with real vampires . What powers and special abilities does Jerry have ? How can he be destroyed ? Everyone knows how to kill a fictional vampire a stake through the heart but does that apply to `` real '' vampires as well ? Because this is Vegas , Charlie contacts a local showman ( and apparent vampire expert who happens to have vampire slaying gear in his apartment ) who tells Charlie the `` rules '' about vampires . It 's good that Charlie checked : Some vampires are said to be able to turn into bats or wolves ; others ca n't . Some are said not to cast a reflection , but others do . Holy water is said to repel or kill vampires , while others sip it with a twist of lime . [ 7 Strange Ways Humans Act Like Vampires ] Other traditional methods of killing vampires include decapitation and stuffing the severed head 's mouth with garlic ; a sacred ( blessed though not silver ) bullet ; a stake through the chest ( not necessarily through the heart ) ; and so on . ( This flexibility , incidentally , is one reason why the vampire genre has been so successful : writers twist old rules and invent new ones to keep the stories fresh . ) As it turns out , Jerry 's abilities are a mix : he does n't cast a reflection , nor change into animals , but he can be killed by sunlight and staking at least sometimes.With so many different claims about vampires , what 's a wannabe Charlie or Buffy to do ? The most important issue is to know some of the `` rules . '' For example , in some traditions the best way to stop a vampire is to carry a small bag of salt with you . If you are being chased , you need only to spill the salt on the ground behind you , at which point the vampire is obligated to stop and count each and every grain before continuing the pursuit . If you do n't have salt handy , some say that any small granules will do , including birdseed and sand . ( It is not known if this defense works on vampires who do n't exhibit obsessive-compulsive traits . ) In some folklore you 're safe in your own home as long as you do n't invite the bloodsucker in . This is one of Van Helsing 's rules about Dracula in Bram Stoker 's classic novel , and that 's the case with Jerry the vampire : He ca n't enter a house without an invitation from someone inside . This is an interesting twist on the idea of a protective magic spell : In this case it 's not a witch or wizard casting a spell , but instead an oblivious layperson whose words break an existing spell by inviting the wrong person into the home.Finding a vampire is not always easy : according to one Romanian legend you 'll need a seven-year-old boy and a white horse . The boy should be dressed in white , placed upon the horse , and the pair set loose in a graveyard at midday . Watch the horse wander around , and whichever grave is nearest the horse when it finally stops is obviously a vampire 's grave.So how is a potential vampire slayer to know what you 're dealing with , whether to bring a handful of salt , a mirror , or a pure-hearted seven-year-old-boy ? There 's really no way to know , since most villains wo n't spell out for you exactly what their limitations and weaknesses are . Your best bet is trial and error .

Some methods include carrying a small bag of salt or tiny granules such as birdseed or sand, which according to certain traditions, a vampire is compelled to count if spilled on the ground. Vampires are also often thought to be unable to enter a home without an explicit invitation. The folklore mentioned suggests a vampire detector could use a seven-year-old boy on a white horse, which would indicate a vampire's grave when it stops. However, assessing a vampire's specific strengths and weaknesses necessitates trial and error due to their variance in different narratives.\n""]"

Key points : Bowen Coking Coal has been given provisional approval for the Isaac River Mine near MoranbahOne of the conditions includes minimising the impact on the ornamental snake 's habitatThe Environmental Council of Central Queensland says the mine should not be allowed to go aheadBowen Coking Coal was told yesterday federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek intended to approve their plan for the Isaac River Mine near Moranbah.One of the conditions for the mine to open is to minimise the impact on a native snake species , with the mining company to ensure it does not clear more than 25 hectares of the reptile 's habitat.The company must also employ a fauna spotter catcher , and the quality and extent of the habitat must be maintained or improved . The ornamental snake will be protected under the approval conditions . ( ABC News ) Final approval expectedAccording to a project decision document , other conditions include providing an offset area detailing a monitoring plan for the snakes , identifying suitable offset sites , and committing to `` achievable ecological outcomes for the offset , which regard the habitat requirements specific to the ornamental snake and its habitat '' .The plan must be submitted to the department for approval of the minister before any construction of the mine can commence.Bowen Coking Coal executive chairman Nick Jorss says he expects it will take about 10 days for the formal approval to come through.The approval for the mine is also conditional on an unusually short five-year operational period.Comparatively , the Carmichael Mine approved in 2015 had an operational approval of 25 to 60 years . Nick Jorss is the Executive Chairman of Bowen Coking Coal . ( ABC Tropical North : Hannah Walsh ) Bowen Coking Coal operates two other Bowen Basin metallurgical mines — Bluff and Burton — which employ about 700 people.Mr Jorss said the metallurgical coal mine would create 200 jobs . `` It 's a fairly modest mine … half a million tonnes or so for four or five years , '' he said . `` We 're not going to build a whole whack of infrastructure . `` The demand for steel continues to grow based on both industrialisation in the developing world but also decarbonisation in the developed world . `` Approval 'out of the blue'Christine Carlisle , the president of the Environmental Council of Central Queensland ( ECoCeQ ) said the provisional approval was disappointing . `` It 's very clear that we should not be opening new coal , whether it 's in a new coal proposal or an expansion of an existing proposal , '' she said . Bowen Coking Coal already operates two coal mines in the region including Burton , which reopened last week . ( ABC Tropical North : Hannah Walsh ) Environmental Justice Australia , on behalf of ECoCeQ , has submitted 19 requests to the minister to not approve pending new coal and gas projects.Ms Carlisle said the Isaac River Mine was not one of the reconsideration requests they put forward . `` That one came a little bit out of the blue , '' she said . `` I 'm not sure how many all together in central Queensland are on the minister 's desk at the moment … we have a lot of those in our reconsideration requests , but not all of them . `` Last federal election is called the climate election . So those people who voted in favour of climate action , I think they 've got a right to feel betrayed by the decisions coming down the line . `` A spokesperson for Minister Plibersek said the government made decisions in accordance with facts and national environment laws . `` The government will continue to consider each project on a case-by-case basis , '' the spokesperson said . `` Since the election we 've doubled renewable energy approvals to a record high . `` Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted 12 May 202312 May 2023Fri 12 May 2023 at 4:51am , updated 12 May 202312 May 2023Fri 12 May 2023 at 6:39amShareCopy linkFacebookX ( formerly Twitter ) Related StoriesQueensland coal projects cancelled over failure to detail environmental impactFederal Energy minister announces new authority to guide coal communities to net zeroMore on : CoalEnvironmental ImpactEnvironmental ManagementFederal GovernmentMackayMining ( Rural ) Mining Environmental IssuesMoranbahRockhamptonTop StoriesA basic security failure from The Iconic has put millions of its customers at risk of being defraudedSouth Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza in landmark International Court of Justice caseState of emergency declared in Papua New Guinea with defence personnel on standby to stop further violenceAn 'extraordinary scenario ' is""]","[""A new coal mine in Queensland's Bowen Basin, run by Bowen Coking Coal, is set to gain federal government approval.

Since the accident in March 2011 , water is needed to continually cool the melted fuel and fuel debris at the Fukushima Daiichi NPS . In addition to the water pumped in for this purpose , groundwater also seeps into the site from the surrounding environment , and rainwater falls into the damaged reactor and turbine buildings . When water comes into contact with melted fuel , fuel debris and other radioactive substances , it becomes contaminated . The contaminated water is then treated through a filtration process known as Advanced Liquid Processing System ( ALPS ) to remove most of the radioactivity before being stored . What is Advanced Liquid Processing System ( ALPS ) ? × ALPS is a pumping and filtration system , which uses a series of chemical reactions to remove 62 radionuclides from contaminated water . However , ALPS is not able to remove tritium from the contaminated water . What is tritium ? × Tritium is a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is produced in the atmosphere when cosmic rays collide with air molecules and has the lowest radiological impact of all naturally occurring radionuclides in seawater . Tritium is also a by-product of operating nuclear power plants to produce electricity . Tritium has a radioactive half-life of 12.32 years . This means that for any given amount of tritium , only half will remain after 12.32 years due to radioactive decay . Tritiated water has a relatively short biological half-life in the human body of 7 to 14 days . The biological half-life of a chemical ( e.g. , a drug ) in a living organism is the time it takes for half of that chemical to be depleted or eliminated from the body . Tritium emits weak beta-particles , i.e. , electrons , with an average energy of 5.7 keV ( kiloelectron-volts ) , which can penetrate about 6.0 mm of air but can not penetrate the body through human skin . It may present a radiation hazard if inhaled or ingested but is only harmful to humans in very large doses . Why isn ’ t tritium removed during treatment ? It is technically very difficult to remove tritiated water from water . Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen , and water containing tritium has chemical features almost identical to water with ordinary hydrogen . Technologies exist that can recover tritium when it is highly concentrated in small amounts of water , for example at nuclear fusion facilities . However , the stored water at the Fukushima Daiichi NPS has a low concentration of tritium in a large volume of water and so the']","[None, 'The FAQ explains that the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) is being used to treat contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. This treatment removes 62 radionuclides from the contaminated water. However, it is unable to remove tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that produces when cosmic rays collide with air molecules and is also by-product of nuclear power plants. Tritium, having half-life of 12.32 years, can only impact humans in large doses and is usually eliminated from the body in 7 to 14 days. Despite the fact it can not penetrate through human skin, it may present a radiation hazard if inhaled or ingested. The removal of tritium from contaminated water is technologically challenging due to its identical chemical features to ordinary hydrogen, making it difficult to distinguish and separate.\n\n']"

Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022 , becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake . Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors , an offer he initially accepted before declining . On April 14 , Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company , to which Twitter 's board responded with a `` poison pill '' strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk 's buyout offer of $ 44 billion on April 25 . Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform , make its algorithms open-source , combat spambot accounts , and promote free speech . In July , Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement , asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts . The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter , with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17 . Weeks before the trial was set to begin , Musk reversed course , announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition . The deal was closed on October 27 , with Musk immediately becoming Twitter 's new owner and CEO . Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives , including previous CEO Parag Agrawal . Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company 's workforce . Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to `` extremely hardcore '' work . Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp . In June 2023 , the Twitter service was rebranded as X . Reactions to the buyout were mixed , with praise for Musk 's planned reforms and vision for the company , particularly his calls for greater free speech , but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation , harassment , and hate speech on the platform . Within the United States , conservatives have largely supported the acquisition , while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk 's intentions . Since becoming owner , Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions , including the December 2022 suspensions of ten journalists .

But the Trump administration has pushed ahead with calls for schools across the country to reopen fully , despite widespread safety concerns.Randi Weingarten , the president of the American Federation of Teachers , told the Guardian she watched Betsy DeVos , the education secretary , with disbelief that turned to anger when she appeared on TV this week to call on schools to be “ fully operational ” this fall. “ It ’ s as if Trump and DeVos want to create chaos and want to jeopardize reopening , ” Weingarten said in an interview . “ There ’ s no other reason why they would be this reckless , this callous , this cruel. ” Florida is setting new infection and death records almost daily . California is returning to lockdown , with bars , restaurants and even offices shuttered . Texas and Arizona are requesting refrigerator trucks as cases increase and morgues are expected to fill to capacity.The Trump administration has made school reopenings one of its main priorities as it attempts to deal with the coronavirus crisis , with less that four months to go until the November election . Trump has tweeted multiple times that schools “ must ” reopen in the fall , and berated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’ s guidelines on reopening schools as too “ tough ” and “ expensive ” .00:01:18The science should not stand in the way of schools reopening , says Kayleigh McEnany – videoTrump has also threatened to withhold federal funding from schools that do not reopen because of coronavirus concerns . Although that is not within his power , Republicans in Congress are now looking to try to attach conditions to emergency school funding in the forthcoming coronavirus relief package.In her television appearance , DeVos excoriated those schools that have opted for online learning or part-time returns.This has foiled months of work from Weingarten ’ s union , which has been conducting its own surveys on how to help teachers back to work . In June , two-thirds of the AFT ’ s 1.7 million members said they would prefer to teach in person at least part-time – on the condition there were safeguards such as masks , physical distancing , ventilation and sanitation.Their recklessness scared people so much that now I fear a brain drain of people basically opting out of teachingRandi WeingartenBroad agreement is no small feat for a teaching workforce in which a quarter – or 1.5 million teachers nationally – are believed to be at heightened risk of Covid-19 complications , because of age or pre-existing conditions . The agreement is also a feat considering recent polls show broad majorities of voters see a return to school as risky. “ They have , from the beginning of this pandemic to now , made this much , much , much worse for not only the 137,000 who have died and the over 3 million Americans who have tested positive , ” said Weingarten . “ Not just in beginning , and the haphazard way we closed , but the haphazard way we will reopen. ” She said : “ Their recklessness scared people so much that now I fear a brain drain of people basically opting out of teaching , because they don ’ t want to jeopardize their own families. ” Few dispute that virtual instruction , even when it is necessary , is inferior to in-person classes . Children are far less likely to be infected by or suffer complications from Covid-19 . However , that risk changes with age and chronic health conditions , and the extent to which children can spread the disease is a matter of disagreement among experts.Schools face myriad logistical challenges . Even as they retrofit buildings , implement enhanced cleaning , and buy more supplies , state budgets hit hard by a pandemic-induced recession are proposing school funding cuts . In one example , New York proposed a 20 % cut in school funding in April. “ You have to have a plan that embeds safety , and the resources to do this , ” said Weingarten.The mounting surge in the American south and south-west has resulted in Covid-19 test result delays of a week or longer , and"", ""How Teachers ' Unions Are Influencing Decisions on School Reopenings Leadership Back Leadership Budget & Finance Equity & Diversity Families & the Community Professional Development Recruitment & Retention School & District Management School Climate & Safety Student Achievement Student Well-Being Policy & Politics Back Policy & Politics Politics K-12 Accountability Education Funding Every Student Succeeds Act Federal International Law & Courts School Choice & Charters States Teaching & Learning Back Teaching & Learning Assessment College & Workforce Readiness Curriculum Early Childhood English-Language Learners Mathematics Reading & Literacy Science Social Studies Special Education Standards Teaching Teacher Preparation Teaching Profession Technology Back Technology Classroom Technology Data Ed-Tech Policy Future of Work IT Infrastructure & Management Personalized Learning Privacy & Security All Topics Jobs Back Jobs Search for Jobs Sign up for Job Alerts Virtual Career Fairs Post a Job Career Advice Careers at EdWeek Opinion Back Opinion Opinion Blogs Submit an Essay Submit a Letter to the Editor About Us Advertising & Marketing Solutions Group Subscriptions Recruitment Advertising Events and Webinars Leaders to Learn From Current Issue Special Reports Newsletters Resources Video EdWeek Research Center EdWeek Top School Jobs EdWeek Market Brief Menu Search Sign In Subscribe How Teachers ’ Unions Are Influencing Decisions on School Reopenings Subscribe Reset Search Leadership Policy & Politics Teaching & Learning Technology Opinion Jobs Market Brief Teaching Profession How Teachers ’ Unions Are Influencing Decisions on School Reopenings By Madeline Will — December 02 , 2020 9 min read Laura Baker/Education Week + DigitalVision Vectors + Getty Share article Remove Save to favorites Save to favorites Print Email Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Copy URL Throughout the pandemic , teachers ’ unions in many states and large districts have played a powerful role in negotiating school closures and reopenings . And with coronavirus cases surging around the nation , the labor groups are continuing to flex their political muscle , most often pushing for a more conservative approach to getting teachers and kids back in buildings.While not all districts need to reach an agreement with their unions to resume in-person instruction , they do need teachers to show up . And in many cases , unions are arguing that they do want students to go back , but only when particular safety precautions are in place. “ Teachers ’ unions have an outsized voice—you can ’ t do reopenings without the teachers , ” said Bradley Marianno , an assistant professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , who studies educational governance and teachers ’ unions . Several statewide teachers ’ unions , including in Illinois , Maryland , and Wisconsin , have put pressure on their governors to shut down schools across the state or set clear benchmarks that dictate when districts will have to close their doors . Currently , 11 states , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico have state-ordered full or partial closures in effect , EdWeek has found.Some local union affiliates have been major players in their reopening debates . In some big cities , including Chicago and Washington , D.C. , labor groups have spoken out against opening school buildings before they are deemed safe . In Los Angeles , the teachers ’ union and the district are negotiating what a return to school buildings would look like , with the union pushing back against a hybrid model that would include both in-person and remote instruction.And the United Federation of Teachers in New York City has been vocal during the twists and turns of the city ’ s school reopening journey . The union first backed the mayor ’ s plan to close schools when the city hit a 3 percent positivity rate—a threshold more conservative than most places in the country—and is now supportive of a phased reopening of schools in parts of the city where transmission rates remain low . ‘ Balance of Power Is Off ’ Many teachers , fearful of getting COVID-19 at work , have said they don ’ t want to go into school buildings , especially as cases in their communities rise . A quarter of all teachers are at increased risk for serious illness if they become infected with the coronavirus , the Kaiser Family Foundation has found , and other teachers say they ’ re scared of bringing the virus home to their high-risk family members . “ The unions have made it pretty clear that they do not want teachers back in school buildings until they ’ re 100 percent sure they ’ re safe , ” said Katharine Strunk , a professor at Michigan State University who studies education labor markets . I think the rallying cry of , ‘ If one teacher dies , isn ’ t that too many ? ’ is a pretty strong argument . Katharine Strunk , professor , Michigan State University Many public health experts have said public schools can—and should—safely reopen in communities with low COVID-19 infection rates and with safety protocols in place , and that there are health and academic risks to keeping children home , too . And a vocal contingent of parents has called for schools to stay open , in some cases clashing with the teachers ’ unions. “ Educators and teachers ’ unions are not infectious disease experts or public health officials , and frankly , that ’ s who parents trust in making these decisions , ” said Keri Rodrigues , the founding president of the National Parents Union , an advocacy organization with hundreds of parent groups across the country.Often , teachers ’ unions are the loudest voices at the decision-making table , Rodrigues said. “ The balance of power is off , ” she said . “ It ’ s very striking to us as parents and families—we have a group of elected officials who make deals with labor unions and decide what policies we ’ re going to do , and we ’ re just supposed to take it and"", None, None]","['The President of the American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten, has called the Trump administration\'s plans to reopen schools during the pandemic ""reckless"" and ""callous"", expressing fears that it may lead to a teacher exodus. President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy Devos have both advocated for US schools to fully reopen, despite increasing cases of Covid-19 in certain states. Weingarten, critical of the move, worries that it might lead to a \'brain drain\' if teachers choose to quit teaching to protect their own families from potential exposure to the virus. She insists that a safety plan and resources for implementation are necessary for schools to reopen.', ""Teachers' unions are playing a significant role in decisions around school reopenings amidst the ongoing pandemic, often pushing for a careful approach. Though not all districts require union agreement to return to in-person teaching, these decisions still necessitate teaching staff to show up for work. Many unions have called for specific safety measures to be in place before schools reopen, while some statewide unions, including those in Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin, have advocated for governors to instigate closures across entire states. However, this stance has, in some places, brought them into conflict with parents calling for schools to remain open. A key point in union arguments is the assertion that reopening schools is only plausible when the environment is considered completely safe.\n"", None, None]"

Lifestyle March 16 2020 Yekaterina Sinelschikova Ramil Sitdikov/Sputnik Is Putin left-handed , ambidextrous , a devoted judoka , or does he just prefer it this way ? We try to answer this peculiar question about Putin and his watch . The habit of wearing a watch on one ’ s left wrist is not something that the Russian president shares . The most eagle-eyed observers must have noticed that he always wears his watch on his right wrist . Why is that ? Russia 's President Vladimir Putin attends a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the Kremlin Wall on June 22 , 2018 . Mikhail Metzel/TASS Is he left-handed ? This is the first thing that comes to mind . It is believed that only left-handed people wear their watch on the right wrist , because writing with the left hand with a watch on it is not very convenient . Yet , this theory is easily crushed : Putin writes with his right hand.There are also people known as ‘ closet left-handers ’ : they perform most tasks with their right hand , and subconsciously shift less significant functions to their left hand . It is hard to say , though , whether Putin is one of them.There is also a theory that he is ambidextrous , i.e . he is able to use his right and left hands equally well . “ Ambidextrous people use both hemispheres at once , they have both - great intuition and logic . In computer language , they have two operating systems installed in parallel and they can use them simultaneously . Of those who are now 50 years old , only one in 10,000 people are ambidextrous , whereas among those who are 30-40 years old , it is already one in a thousand . To give you an idea of what these people are like , Russian President Putin is one of them , ” says psychophysiologist Vladimir Pugach , MD.Meridian points ? President Vladimir Putin during a judo training session on February 14 , 2019 . Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik Another theory has to do with judo . Vladimir Putin , as an experienced practitioner of judo and sambo , must have heard of meridian lines and points on the body that serve as energy channels ( according to an ancient Chinese system of meditation known as ‘ Fukuri ’ ) . This teaching is shared by many people who practise martial arts . It states that men have three important meridian points on their left wrist , including one that is responsible for the work of the heart . If you believe that watch straps can block these points , it would make sense to wear your watch on the other wrist . In the 2000s , the press speculated a lot that this may be the reason why Putin wears his watch on the right wrist.The crownAlas , now we will have to crush all these beautiful theories . Because Putin himself explained once why he wears his watch on his right wrist . This intriguing question was first put to him at the end of his two-hour live phone-in with the nation in 2002. “ I wear my watch on my right hand , because that way , the crown doesn ’ t scratch my wrist . That ’ s all there is to it , ” Putin said then.By 2018 , everyone must have forgotten the president ’ s explanation and the question arose once more . And the answer was the same : “ If you wear it on your left hand , the crown , which turns , makes it uncomfortable and painful . That is why I moved it to the other wrist. ” If using any of Russia Beyond 's content , partly or in full , always provide an active hyperlink to the original material . putin Subscribeto our newsletter !

All rights reserved . A video has been viewed thousands of times in multiple posts on Facebook , Twitter and YouTube which claim the footage shows a “ rain clouds generator engine ” developed by US Space Agency NASA . The claim is false ; the video has been taken from a 2010 episode of the BBC ’ s Top Gear program ; NASA said the footage actually showed tests of rocket engines . The footage was shared in this September 29 , 2018 Facebook post , where it has been viewed more than 3,500 times . Below is a screenshot of the misleading post : The 59-second video shows a large machine emitting a huge plume of white-coloured smoke . The misleading post ’ s caption says : “ Rain clouds generator engine developed by Nasa . See where the world is moving ... Amazing ... ! ” NASA refers to The National Aeronautics and Space Administration . The same video was shared with a similar claim on Facebook here and here . The same video was shared on Twitter here and on YouTube here with a similar claim . The claim is false ; most of the video has been captured from a 2001 episode of `` Speed '' , part of the BBC ’ s Top Gear program . The footage in the misleading post contains a BBC watermark on top-left corner . Former BBC presenter Jeremy Clarkson can be seen in the clip . In the video , Clarkson says to the camera : “ Don ’ t worry if you can ’ t hear what I ’ m saying , I couldn ’ t even hear myself . This is the loudest sound you could possibly conceive . And , as it turns out , the cleanest . Now , the most amazing thing is that that cloud up there , which was generated by the engine , is just a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen -- it ’ s water vapour ! And in about an hours time , someone in Mississippi is going to get wet washing , it will actually rain ! [ sound of rain ] I told you ! It ’ s raining ! That ’ s unbelievable ! NASA ’ s playing god , it ’ s making its own weather. ” A reverse image search on Google found this corresponding video published on the verified YouTube channel of the BBC ’ s Top Gear program on October 29 , 2010 . The title of the video says : ‘ Space Shuttle Rocket Booster Test | Speed | Top Gear ’ . The caption of the 2-minutes 52-seconds video states : `` Jeremy Clarkson heads to Mississippi where NASA test their Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters . Consuming half a million gallons of fuel , they generate the thrust needed to propel astronauts into space . '' The Top Gear video corresponds with the video in the misleading posts from the 1-minute 54-seconds mark until the 2-minutes-47 seconds mark . Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post ( L ) and YouTube video of the ‘ Space Shuttle Rocket Booster Test ’ ( R ) : NASA ’ s news chief Valerie Buckingham told AFP that the misleading footage did not show a rain cloud machine . “ No , we have not created an engine for the specific purpose of generating clouds . Let me provide some clarification , ” Buckingham told AFP by email on July 10 . The first five seconds of the misleading Facebook video -- which do not appear in the Top Gear program -- show an RS-25 engine test , Buckingham said . “ The Facebook video is a combined video of the RS-25 engine on the A-1 stand and the RS-68 commercial engine on the B-1 stand at NASA ’ s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi , ” she said . The Top Gear YouTube clip shows “ the RS-68 commercial test at Stennis , ” she said . According to Buckingham : “ The engines in the video run on liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants . The chemical composition of water is H2O ( hydrogen and oxygen ) . These are mixed in the combustion chamber and ignited , which results in extremely high-temperature steam ( 6000 degree F ) coming out of the nozzle at a very high rate and pressure . That steam rises in the atmosphere , creating a steam cloud that cools off and turns back into water and rains depending on the temperature and humidity at the time of the test . There is also water flowing in the flame deflector which also mixes in the cloud . The steam released during a test is water and does not pollute the atmosphere. ” The first five seconds of footage in the misleading posts has been captured from this video published on NASA 's official YouTube channel on October 19 , 2017 . The video 's title states : `` NASA Tests RS-25 Flight Engine for Space Launch System '' . The video is embedded below : UPDATED : this story was updated 22/07/2019 to change the date of the footage mentioned paragraph eight .

Por otro lado , el altruismo y la voluntariedad de la donación de sangre son la mejor garantía de calidad y seguridad para el donante y el receptor , hecho que ha quedado especialmente patente tras el conocimiento de nuevas enfermedades emergentes que pueden ser trasmitidas por la sangre y que ha llevado a potenciar y diseñar políticas de autosuficiencia comunitaria basadas en donaciones altruistas desde instituciones como la Organización Mundial de la Salud , la Unión Europea , y el Consejo de Europa . El Real Decreto 1945/1985 , de 9 de octubre , por el que se regula la hemodonación y los bancos de sangre , resolvía por un lado los problemas técnicos advertidos y se acomodaba a dos exigencias esenciales en una doble vertiente legal y social , la de establecer la donación como acto voluntario y altruista , y la de la organización territorial del Estado y la consiguiente distribución de competencias . El Real Decreto 1854/1993 , de 22 de octubre , por el que se determinan con carácter general los requisitos técnicos y condiciones mínimas de la hemodonación y bancos de sangre , estableció en su día las nuevas exigencias técnicas , siguiendo las recomendaciones realizadas por la Comisión Nacional de Hemoterapia y los organismos internacionales competentes . Dentro del proceso de permanente adaptación a los nuevos conocimientos científicos , se enmarcan , igualmente , la Orden de 7 de febrero de 1996 , de desarrollo del Real Decreto 1854/1993 , de 22 de octubre , por la que se determinan los criterios y condiciones de exclusión de donantes de sangre ; la Orden de 2 de julio de 1999 , por la que se actualizan las condiciones de exclusión de los donantes de sangre y se establecen los criterios de interpretación de las pruebas para la detección de agentes infecciosos en las donaciones de sangre ; la Orden de 2 de junio de 1998 , por la que se establecen principios de actuación dirigidos a la seguridad del plasma para uso transfusional , y la Orden SCO/1647/2002 , de 19 de junio , por la que se establece la utilización de pruebas de detección genómica del virus de la hepatitis C ( VHC ) en las donaciones de sangre . Asimismo , para facilitar el cumplimiento de las nuevas directrices europeas y lograr una mayor coordinación autonómica que permitiera aportar respuestas más ágiles ante nuevas situaciones , se modificó la estructura de seguimiento del Plan Nacional de Hemoterapia mediante el Real Decreto 62/2003 , de 17 de enero , por el que se modifica el Real Decreto 1945/1985 , de 9 de octubre , por el que se regula la hemodonación y los bancos de sangre . Como continuación y a fin de contribuir a garantizar un nivel elevado de calidad y seguridad de la sangre y sus componentes , equivalente en todos los Estados miembros , así como para contribuir a reforzar la confianza del ciudadano en la transfusión , se adoptó la Directiva 2002/98/CE del Parlamento Europeo y del Consejo , de 27 de enero de 2003 , por la que se establecen normas de calidad y de seguridad para""]",[None]

NewslettersArchiveVF ShopMagazineTwitterA Reminder of Just Some of the Terrible Things Elon Musk Has Said and DoneFrom regularly attacking his perceived enemies to running a company accused of rampant racism and sexism , it ’ s not hard to see why so many people are up in arms about him taking over Twitter.By Bess LevinApril 26 , 202213 August 2021 , Brandenburg , GrÃ¼nheide : Elon Musk , Tesla CEO , stands in the foundry of the Tesla Gigafactory during a press event . The first vehicles are scheduled to roll off the production line in GrÃ¼nheide near Berlin from the end of 2021 . The US company plans to build around 500,000 units of the compact Model 3 and Model Y series here each year . Photo : Patrick Pleul/dpa-Zentralbild/ZB ( Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images ) picture allianceSave this storySaveSave this storySaveLike the employees of Twitter , who reportedly reacted to yesterday ’ s news with “ shock and dismay , ” a lot of people are not enthused about the idea of Elon Musk buying the social media network . But now , he is , and if you ’ re not familiar with the guy , or just think of him as the dude who sells electric cars and is really into space , you might be wondering why so many people are up in arms .

Nun gab die israelische Armee zu Protokoll , dass ihr diesbezügliche Ereignisse nicht bekannt seien . © Screenshot : Bild.de711.10.23Die Schlagzeile zählt , nicht der potenzielle Wahrheitsgehalt.In Zeiten von kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen gilt auch weiterhin die bedauerliche mediale Realität , dass je blutrünstiger die Berichterstattung , desto höher die Garantie auf erwünschte Wahrnehmung . Exemplarisches Beispiel ist ein vermeintlich brutales Ereignis im Grenzgebiet zu Gaza , welches am 10 und 11 . Oktober seinen Weg in die internationalen Medien fand . Eine Reporterin des israelischen Mediums i24-News behauptete in einer Video-Reportage , dass die `` Hamas-Terroristen mindestens 40 Babys und Kleinkinder abschlachteten '' . Die türkische Nachrichtenagentur Anadolu Ajansı kontaktierte daraufhin die Pressestelle der israelischen Armee . In dem Artikel heißt es nun : '' Ein Sprecher der israelischen Armee teilt Anadolu telefonisch mit , dass ihr keine Informationen vorliegen , die die Behauptung bestätigen , dass die `` Hamas Babys enthauptet '' hat . '' Israelische Abgeordnete fordert den Einsatz von `` Waffe des Jüngsten Gerichts '' gegen Gaza Die sogenannte `` Brutkastenlüge '' war ein ähnlich strukturiertes Medienereignis aus dem Jahr 1990 . Bewusst manipulierend wurde dabei die Falschbehauptung lanciert , dass irakische Soldaten bei der Invasion Kuwaits im August 1990 , dem Beginn des Zweiten Golfkriegs , `` kuwaitische Frühgeborene getötet hätten , indem sie diese aus ihren Brutkästen gerissen und auf dem Boden hätten sterben lassen '' . Rund dreißig Jahre später heißt es in dem betreffenden X-Posting : '' i24NEWS-Korrespondentin Nicole Zedek berichtet aus dem Kibbuz Kfar Aza , eine Viertelmeile von der Grenze zum Gazastreifen entfernt , und erzählt von den Gräueltaten , die in der kleinen Gemeinde begangen wurden . `` Die Reporterin war dabei Bestandteil einer Pressegruppe , die unter Begleitung von israelischen Soldaten den Kibbuz aufsuchte . Sie berichtete dann in ihrer Moderation über Informationen eines Soldaten , die sich später auch im i24NEWS-Schriftartikel wiederfinden . So heißt es wörtlich : '' Einige Soldaten berichten , dass sie Babys mit abgetrennten Köpfen gefunden hätten , ganze Familien seien in ihren Betten erschossen worden . Etwa 40 Säuglinge und Kleinkinder wurden auf Bahren abtransportiert – bis jetzt . `` Weltweite Redaktionen übernahmen unmittelbar und ohne zu hinterfragen diese Darstellung von Ereignissen .

Internationale Schlagzeilen lauteten hinsichtlich der unreflektierten Übernahme : New York Post : Hamas tötet 40 Babys und Kinder – einige von ihnen werden enthauptetCNN : Nach Angaben der IDF wurden in einem israelischen Kibbuz `` geschlachtete '' Kinder gefundenDaily Express ( England ) : Das ist kein Krieg und keine Schlacht . Es ist ein `` Massaker '' : Entsetzen über die `` absolut böse Enthauptung von Babys '' Aska News ( Italien ) : Israel : Hamas tötet 40 Kinder im Kibbuz von Kfar AzaVermeintlich untermauert wurden die Informationen ungenannter Soldaten durch die Aussage von General Itai Veruv , Chef-Kommandeur des Tiefenkorps der israelischen Verteidigungsstreitkräfte . Dieser teilte laut Times of Israel den anwesenden Journalisten vor Ort im Kibbuz mit : '' Sie sehen diese Babys , diese Mütter , diese Väter in ihren Zimmern , in ihren sicheren Räumen , sehen Sie , wie die Terroristen sie getötet haben . Das ist kein Krieg ... das ist ein Massaker . `` Der Artikel der türkischen Nachrichtenagentur zeichnet demgegenüber ein anderes Bild . Bezüglich der offiziellen Wahrnehmung der israelischen Armee heißt es wörtlich in dem Beitrag : '' Als Anadolu die Sprecherin der israelischen Armee telefonisch zu den Vorwürfen befragte , sagte sie : `` Wir haben die Nachrichten gesehen , aber wir haben keine Details oder Bestätigung dafür . `` Die Journalistin Christine Kensche , die für die Springer-Publikation Welt , die US-Zeitung Politico und den österreichischen Standard arbeitet , kommentierte via X-Posting zur Causa `` Hamas-Babys '' am Dienstagvormittag , dass sie ebenfalls Informationen des israelischen Verteidigungsministeriums ( IDF ) erhalten hätte . Das IDF würde demnach `` keine Zahlen bestätigen , was jedoch im Kibbuz 'Kfar Azza ' passiert ist , ist ein Massaker , bei dem Frauen , Kinder , Kleinkinder und ältere Menschen in einer ISIS-Aktion brutal abgeschlachtet wurden '' .

By Brian Koerber on September 14 , 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard The internet has always been filled with hoaxes , fakes , liars , and cheats , long before the term `` fake news '' became a household phrase . But no matter how many times a fake image of a shark swimming on a flooded highway shows up , the internet continues to fall for it . Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had major impacts on the U.S. in the last few weeks , which means social media was ripe with incredible stories , videos , and pictures of the storms and their aftermaths . Among the real stories , there were of course fakes . On Aug. 27 , Twitter user Jason Michael shared an infamous photo of a shark swimming on a flooded highway . `` Believe it or not , this is a shark on the freeway in Houston , Texas , '' he wrote . SEE ALSO : 'Pilot ' says he Photoshops his selfies , and yet somehow people still think they 're real Tweet may have been deleted Turns out the Dublin-based journalist was apparently just trying to make a point . The tweet received over 88,000 retweets , and Michael later responded that he was concerned how easy it was to fool so many people with fake news . Tweet may have been deleted As Hurricane Irene was battering Florida on Sunday , the same image was shared by Twitter user @ mopage19 . He claimed the photo was taken on I-75 outside of Naples . Tweet may have been deleted `` This is insane , '' he wrote.Later , someone asked if he knew where the photo actually originated . Mopage19 made it clear that he was just trolling . Tweet may have been deleted The shark in this photograph is indeed real , but the shark swimming through a flooded highway is fake . The shark was initially captured by renowned National Geographic photographer Thomas P. Peschak off the coast of South Africa over 10 years ago.On his website , Peschak explains that he was working with the White Shark Trust for more than 10 months to capture images of white sharks in South Africa that would help depict the current scientific research . The story of this particular photograph began on a perfectly calm and glassy sea . I tied myself to the tower of the White Shark Trust research boat and leaned into the void , precariously hanging over the ocean while waiting patiently . The first shark came across our sea kayak , dove to the seabed , and inspected it from below . I trained my camera on the nebulous shadow as it slowly transformed into the sleek silhouette of a large great white . When the shark ’ s dorsal fin emerged , I thought I had the shot but hesitated a fraction of a second . In that moment , the research assistant in the kayak , Trey Snow , turned to look behind him , and I took the shot . Throughout the day I shot many more similar images , but all lacked the connection of first image . View this post on Instagram The image of the shark stalking a small kayak went viral when Peschak first published it on his website . He claims the photo attracted `` more than 100,000 visitors '' in 24 hours . Given the stunning nature of the image , the photographer says that it garnered its fair share of skeptics claiming the image was altered in some manner . The original image even has its own debunking on Snopes.Peschak maintains the image was not altered in any way , in fact , he told AOL Travel in 2014 that the photo was captured `` on slide film Fuji Provia 100 using a Nikon F5 Camera and 17-35 mm lens . '' On his site , he writes , `` all magazines and prints were taken from a high-resolution scan of the slide with no post-production work . '' This means the original photo never even touched Photoshop , until someone decided to take that shark and put it on a flooded highway . It appears as if the first hoax surrounding the image occurred in April 2006 , when the French magazine Le Magazine des Voyages de Peche published a joke article about a fisherman in Australia that accidentally caught a shark in one of its nets . After freeing the shark , affectionately named Cindy , it followed the fisherman around years , scaring away his catch in the process . Two years later , someone turned the April Fools ' Day joke into a YouTube slideshow""]","['A fake photo of a shark swimming on a flooded highway continues to be shared on social media despite multiple cases of it being debunked. The photo originally surfaced during Hurricane Harvey and Irma, with a Twitter user claiming it was taken in Houston, Texas. The picture has resurfaced time and again during various weather disasters. In reality, the shark in the image is real, but it was not captured swimming on a highway. It was actually photographed by National Geographic photographer Thomas P. Peschak off the coast of South Africa over a decade ago. The image was then altered to make it appear as if the shark was swimming on a highway.']"

Covid-19 spurred on the Great Resignation of 2021 , during which record numbers of employees voluntarily quit their jobs . But what we are living through is not just short-term turbulence provoked by the pandemic . Instead , it ’ s the continuation of a trend of rising quit rates that began more than a decade ago . Five main factors are at play in this trend : retirement , relocation , reconsideration , reshuffling , and reluctance . All of these factors , the authors argue , are here to stay . They explore each in turn and encourage leaders to examine which of them are contributing most to turnover in their organizations , so that they can adapt appropriately as they move into the future .

The agreement was finalized after three months of talks by the Zionist Federation of Germany , the Anglo-Palestine Bank ( under the directive of the Jewish Agency ) and the economic authorities of Nazi Germany . It was a major factor in making possible the migration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine between 1933 and 1939 .

[ 2 ] Emigrants sold their assets in Germany to pay for essential goods ( manufactured in Germany ) to be shipped to Mandatory Palestine . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The agreement was controversial and was criticised by many Jewish leaders both within the Zionist movement ( such as the Revisionist Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky ) and outside it , as well as by members of both the Nazi Party and the German public . [ 4 ] For German Jews , the agreement offered a way to leave an increasingly hostile environment in Germany ; for the Yishuv , the Jewish community in Palestine , it offered access to both immigrant labour and economic support ; for the Germans it facilitated the emigration of German Jews while breaking the anti-Nazi boycott of 1933 , which had mass support among European and American Jews and was thought by the German state to be a potential threat to the German economy . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Background Although the Nazi Party won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932 , they did not have a majority , so Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the Nazis and the German National People 's Party . [ 6 ] Under pressure from politicians , industrialists and others , President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 . This event is known as the Machtergreifung ( seizure of power ) . [ 7 ] In the following months , the Nazis used a process termed Gleichschaltung ( co-ordination ) to consolidate power .

Ron DeSantis in West Columbia , S.C. , on Tuesday.Meg Kinnard / APSHARE THIS —July 18 , 2023 , 6:08 PM EDTBy Matt DixonRon DeSatis was on his best behavior Tuesday.The Florida governor made his return to mainstream media , an institution he has trashed and ignored for five years , to do a 15-minute interview with CNN 's Jake Tapper . It was not marked by the overly aggressive name-calling or overt annoyance that has defined DeSantis ’ relationship with traditional media over the past few years.He even engaged in friendly banter , recalling a CNN poll from 2018 that showed him losing the gubernatorial race that he ended up winning. “ You didn ’ t have anything to do with it , ” DeSantis joked with Tapper.The back and forth with a well-known journalist outside conservative circles was a vastly different look for DeSantis . As governor , he pushed for state laws to eliminate legal protections for reporters , elevated communications staffers who attack them publicly , and created an insular right-wing media bubble that allowed him to bypass traditional press outlets.But as his presidential campaign has stagnated , it 's signaled that DeSantis would again return to his longtime political foe : the mainstream media.The interview comes a couple of weeks after DeSantis took questions from NBC News when he rolled out his border policy . Tapper asked DeSantis about his White House bid , including the fact he is a very distant second to former President Donald Trump in most public polling , the red flags embedded in his first campaign finance report , and having to fire more than a dozen staffers after just two months after announcing his candidacy. “ They have been saying that I have been doing poorly for my whole time as governor , basically , ” DeSantis said.He noted that he secured a historic re-election in November , winning by nearly 20 percentage points , and said part of the reason he is off to a slow start is that he had to focus on Florida ’ s Legislature during the opening months of 2023. “ I had to do my job as governor with our legislative session , ” DeSantis said . “ I was basically taking fire really non-stop since then. ” Tapper noted that one of DeSantis ’ priorities , the fight against so-called wokeness , is not seen as a top-level policy issue by respondents in most public polling . DeSantis said that ’ s because not enough people know what it means. “ Not everyone really knows what wokeness is , ” DeSantis said . “ I mean , I have defined it , but a lot of people who rail against wokeness can not even define it. ” DeSantis has defined the term as a type of “ cultural marxism ” that puts “ merit and achievement behind identity politics. ” The idea that most public institutions are “ infected with the woke mind virus ” was the defining feature of nearly all of DeSantis ’ policy proposals during his first term as governor , and the early policies outlined as he runs for president.The latest iteration of that came Tuesday when DeSantis unveiled his plan to “ rip the woke out of the military. ” The proposal echoed many other DeSantis policies in recent years . He wants to remove diversity and equity programs from the military , prohibit transgender people from serving as they identify , and reenlist service members who were separated due to not following Covid vaccine mandates.Tapper noted that the Pentagon has said that DeSantis ’ concerns are not reflective of reality , which is that military readiness is high . DeSantis responded by pointing to record low recruiting numbers. “ I think you have a big problem with morale , ” he said . “ You clearly have a problem with recruiting. ” Recommended2024 ElectionFour takeaways from the GOP debate : Trump skates as Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley clashDeSantis ’ return to mainstream media came on the same day Trump said he received a letter indicating he is the target of a Washington-based grand jury looking at the Jan. 6 riot and attempts to overturn the 2020 election . Trump ’ s announcement , via Truth Social , quickly became a central focus of the day ’ s news cycle , and once again prompted Republicans , including those running against Trump , to come to his defense . `` Here is the problem , this country is going down a road of criminalizing political differences , ” DeSantis told Tapper , echoing the sentiment of most other Republicans who say Trump is being unfairly targeted.DeSantis said he does not think Trump “ should get charged , ” and went on to criticize Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg who indicted Trump in June over allegations he made hush money payments to an adult film star and covered them up. “ If that was not Trump , ” DeSantis said . “ That case would likely not have been brought against a normal civilian. ” Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges.DeSantis said that , if""]","[""Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has returned to mainstream media following a stagnating presidential campaign and a five-year period marked by hostility towards traditional media.

This was a landslide. ” National Elections Donald Trump President Donald Trump speaks at a rally near the White House on Jan. 6 , 2021 , in Washington . ( AP ) By Daniel Funke January 6 , 2021 Here ’ s how we know Trump ’ s repeated claim of a landslide victory is wrong A mob breached the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 , forcing evacuations in both chambers of Congress and halting the Electoral College vote count — a historic insurrection against the federal government . The chaotic day started with a demonstration at the White House to promote the falsehood that President Donald Trump won the 2020 election . For more than two months , Trump has uttered and encouraged inaccurate claims that the election was stolen from him to put Joe Biden in the White House . The claims festered on social media and found a home on television networks like Fox News , One America News and Newsmax . In remarks to his supporters on Jan. 6 , Trump doubled down on his false claim to victory . He said lawmakers were trying to `` illegally take over our country '' and encouraged people to march toward the Capitol , which they did . RELATED : A day of crisis at the US Capitol , fact-checked `` We won . We won in a landslide , '' he said during a speech on the Ellipse outside the White House . `` This was a landslide . '' No , it was not a landslide . And he didn ’ t win . Here ’ s how we know that : All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results , which Congress sought to finalize Jan. 6 . Those results show that Biden won with 306 electoral votes , to Trump ’ s 232 . Biden won the popular vote by about 7 million . There is no evidence that voter fraud affected that outcome . Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process . The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its election partners called the 2020 election `` the most secure in American history . '' Former Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud . Barr reiterated that point before his Dec. 23 resignation . Not one of the 62 lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed in state and federal courts has proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome . The suits have been dismissed by Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges . PolitiFact has fact-checked dozens of allegations of voter fraud before and after Election Day . Under the Constitution , states have the power to administer elections and count votes . The states certified their results , some following audits and recounts , almost a month ago . Each state has its own process for certifying results , but here is how the process generally works : Featured Fact-check Instagram posts stated on December 12 , 2023 in a video As of Dec. 12 , 2023 , Geert Wilders was the “ new prime minister of the Netherlands. ” By Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu • December 13 , 2023 After voters cast their ballots , local election workers tabulate them at ballot-counting centers , where Republican , Democratic and nonpartisan challengers observe the process . They verify that the results match the number of votes cast , and that provisional ballots were cast legally . Local election offices then send the results to a county canvassing or certification board , which is typically bipartisan . If there doesn ’ t appear to be a problem with the vote tally , the results are passed on to the state for final certification . A state canvassing board , the secretary of state or other officials certify the election results . Each state had until Dec. 8 to certify its results and send them to the federal government . Anyone can access copies of the Electoral College certificates from the National Archives . There is no credible reason to believe that that process was plagued by fraud in 2020 . In Georgia , where Biden had one of his slimmest margins of victory , two recounts — including one conducted by hand — reaffirmed his victory . Georgia ’ s secretary of state , a Republican , has repeatedly swatted down claims that voter fraud affected the vote . Both chambers of Congress met Jan. 6 to formally count the Electoral College votes and finalize the election results , but the session was disrupted by the Capitol breach .""]","['Donald Trump\'s claim of a landslide victory in the 2020 US Presidential Election is false, according to PolitiFact.

Biden secured 306 electoral votes to Trump\'s 232, and also won the popular vote by approximately 7 million. State and national officials saw no significant evidence of voter fraud. Furthermore, every single one of the 62 lawsuits that Trump and his supporters filed in different courts across the country failed to provide proof that voter fraud affected the final outcome.

Tesla ’ s stock has risen over 30 % since announcing the proposed stock split in June . Patrick Pleul/Pool via Associated Press Key Facts Tesla ’ s stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis after the market close on Wednesday , with each investor gaining roughly two additional shares under the latest stock split , which was approved by shareholders earlier this month . Tesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the nearly $ 900 stock more affordable ; based on today ’ s closing price the new share price would be just under $ 300 per share . Though the stock is down roughly 25 % this year amid the wider market selloff , billionaire Elon Musk ’ s electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge roughly 200 % since the last stock split in August 2020 . Stock splits don ’ t impact a company ’ s market value , but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors , the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price . Tesla shares are up roughly 25 % since announcing the 3:1 split in early June , while news of Tesla ’ s 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70 % higher in the 20 days following the announcement . Several other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price ; Google-parent Alphabet ’ s split 20:1 in February and Amazon ’ s stock split 20:1 split one month later . Crucial Quote : “ When stocks trade in a so-called comfortable range , everyday investors can more easily afford a piece of the company , ” according to Lindsey Bell , Ally ’ s chief money & markets strategist . “ That drives more interest in the shares and more interest means more people trading the stock. ” Key Background : Tesla reported mixed second quarter earnings last month which largely beat analyst expectations . Production took a hit , however , worrying analysts as the company was impacted by ongoing supply chain disruptions as well as a factory closure in China that was due to Covid-related government lockdowns . Tesla ’ s quarterly revenue of $ 16.9 billion rose 42 % from a year ago , though it fell from a record high of $ 18.7 billion in the previous quarter , ending the company ’ s streak of record profits . “ In a nutshell , the quarter was better than feared with healthy guidance ” for the rest of the year , which certainly “ look [ s ] achievable with no margin for error , '' Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said following the earnings report . Chief Critic : Tesla shares are overpriced and could plunge more than 50 % , according to Citi analysts , who maintain a “ sell ” rating on the stock with a $ 424 price target . “ The current valuation remains challenging , ” especially when considering that the few other companies that achieved a similar market cap did so by generating on average around $ 100 billion in annualized gross profit versus Tesla ’ s annualized profit of $ 20 billion in the first half of the""]","[""Tesla's 3:1 stock split has officially come into effect which led to an increase in shares for its investors and a decrease in the price per share. This split was a strategy by Tesla to make the stock more affordable. This decision is the second time in two years Tesla has split its shares, the last time in August 2020 led to a roughly 200% increase in share price. Despite being down about 25% this year, Tesla's shares are expected to increase in value due to more people trading the stock at the newly affordable price.\n""]"

La avería ha afectado durante todo el día a 13.800 viajeros de las compañías Renfe ( 7.000 ) , Ouigo ( 4.000 ) e Iryo ( 2.800 ) , según fuentes de las compañías . . Renfe ha podido recolocar a la mayor parte de sus afectados de sus servicios AVE y AVLO , con autocares y trenes con otras rutas . Iryo ha recolocado a 500 viajeros en autocares y otros 1.600 han anulado su billete . y Ouigo ha informado a sus usuarios que les devolverá el dinero más una compensación adicional.Adif , la empresa responsable de la infraestructura ferroviaria , trabaja en la reparación de la avería y en torno a las 20,30 horas de este domingo ha señalado que prevé que los trabajos para restablecer el tráfico se prolongarán durante la noche . El incidente coincide con un día de gran circulación y la jornada electoral , que ha impedido a varios ciudadanos viajar para ejercer su derecho al voto . El Gobierno regional del PP ha exigido al Ministerio de Transportes , de quien depende Adif , que proporcione una solución rápida al problema para garantizar ese derecho . De manera paralela , ha salido el presidente valenciano , Carlos Mazón , del PP , para pedir al Gobierno que “ ponga todos los medios para garantizar la democracia ” y puedan “ ejercer el derecho a voto ” . “ Es frustrante ” , ha dicho Mazón en su cuenta de Twitter que la línea entre Madrid y Valencia sufra una avería justo en las elecciones.La delegada del Gobierno en la Comunitat Valenciana , Pilar Bernabé , ha concretado que el fuego , del que estudiarán las causas , ha quemado las bombas de agua , lo que ha provocado que el túnel se haya inundado , pues no se ha podido desaguar el agua que han utilizado los bomberos para sofocar las llamas . Las labores de restablecimiento de la normalidad han sido al inicio especialmente complejas , ha añadido , porque en el pozo había “ una concentración importante ” de monóxido de carbono , aunque sobre las 10.30 horas los técnicos han podido finalmente acceder a ese área.Adif , la empresa pública encargada de la gestión de las vías y túneles , ha informado que desde las 3.46 de esta madrugada se encuentra suspendida la circulación entre Xátiva y la estación de Joaquin Sorolla de Valencia por la acumulación de agua que ha alcanzado un nivel de 80 centímetros sobre el carril en el túnel de San Isidro , el de acceso de alta velocidad a Valencia . La incidencia ha sido originada por un incendio en una arqueta que ha afectado a las bombas que achican el agua del túnel , lo que ha imposibilitado su drenaje . Se estima que se ha quemado el cableado de las bombas con el incendio , aunque todavía no ha sido posible acceder al túnel . El nivel freático del túnel está por debajo del nivel del mar y las bombas cumplen la función de achicar el agua , informaron fuentes del organismo.Como sucede en este tipo de incidencias , se ha activado el protocolo con bomberos y otras fuerzas de seguridad del Estado . Los bomberos han sofocado el incendio a las 6.05 , que ha provocado humo en el túnel , por lo que tampoco se ha podido operar en su interior de forma inmediata , debido al alto nivel de monóxido de carbono . Una vez comprobado que las bombas no estaban cumpliendo su función , se han activado alternativas —entre ellas , se ha solicitado un camión bomba para sacar agua y se trabaja en las bombas dañadas— . Finalmente , se ha optado por montar una bomba exterior , que ha llegado a las 12.15 y con la que se trabajaba pasadas las dos de la tarde con 50 operarios en las tareas . Las valoraciones iniciales han hecho pensar en una incidencia que podría resolverse en un plazo prudencial ; cuando se ha visto que no era así , antes de las 8.00 , se ha suspendido la salida de trenes desde las estaciones . La complejidad de la incidencia hace que no haya todavía una estimación del tiempo para su solución , ha explicado el director general de Conservación y Mantenimiento de Adif , Ángel Contreras , a pie de estación.Medidas de Renfe , Iryo y OuigoLo que más afecta es lo que sucede más cerca .

By Kyle Cheney and Nicholas Wu 12/18/2022 05:08 PM EST Updated : 12/19/2022 02:56 PM EST Link Copied The Jan. 6 select committee on Monday voted to formally accuse Donald Trump of four crimes , including assisting an insurrection , in his bid to subvert the transfer of presidential power to Joe Biden . The panel contended that its evidence proved Trump provided “ aid and comfort ” to a mob that was ransacking the Capitol in service of his attempts to reverse his loss in 2020 . It also said Trump could be charged with obstructing Congress ’ Jan. 6 joint session , conspiracy to make false statements to the National Archives and conspiracy to defraud the United States . The panel has long contended Trump broke the law . But its new report — which the committee voted to release but has yet to become public — is expected to add vivid new details of that effort , particularly about the cast of enablers who facilitated Trump ’ s gambit , from Republican members of Congress to a team of lawyers pushing fringe legal theories to shadowy operatives awash in conspiracies . The panel also released the 160-page executive summary of its report , capturing the contours of its case against Trump . Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D-Miss . ) , chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol , speaks with reporters after the committee 's final meeting on Capitol Hill on Dec. 19 , 2022 . | Francis Chung/POLITICO “ Faith in our system is the foundation of American democracy . If the faith is broken , so is our democracy , ” said select panel chair Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D-Miss. ) . “ Donald Trump broke that faith . He lost the 2020 election and knew it , but he chose to try to stay in office through a multi-part scheme. ” “ This can never happen again , ” Thompson added . The recommended referral for insurrection mentions U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ’ s ruling in February , which said Trump ’ s language plausibly incited violence on Jan. 6 and cited the Senate ’ s 57 votes in last year ’ s impeachment trial to convict Trump on “ incitement of insurrection. ” Charging decisions rest entirely with DOJ prosecutors , not Congress , but panel members have increasingly stressed the impact their transmission to the department could have on public opinion — viewing it as part of building a historical record around the attack . Special Counsel Jack Smith is currently conducting a wide-ranging investigation of Trump ’ s scheme to cling to power , and the select panel has also moved in parallel with DOJ ’ s effort to prosecute hundreds of Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol . More significant than the referrals to the department and other outside entities could be the enormous cache of evidence the panel is readying for release this week . That includes transcripts of more than 1,000 witness interviews and documents that could help prosecutors determine which witnesses might have committed crimes . The select committee ’ s final meeting came on the two-year anniversary of Trump ’ s Dec. 19 , 2020 , tweet in which he urged allies to descend on Washington for a “ wild ” protest against the election results . Congressional and DOJ investigators view that tweet as a crucial turning point — emboldening extremists who were seeking to aid Trump ’ s effort and sparking an intense focus on a day that is typically a ceremonial aspect of the transfer of power . Court records show that in dozens of cases , particularly among members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys , the tweet was seen as a call to action and a validation of their desire to “ stop the steal. ” Trump , who routinely reiterates discredited claims that the 2020 election was stolen and should be invalidated — a constitutional impossibility — spent the weekend railing against the select committee , which he described as a group of “ misfits ” and “ thugs. ” Members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol meet to discuss the committee 's final report on Capitol Hill on Dec. 19 , 2022 . | Francis Chung/POLITICO The select panel ’ s interviews continued all the way through November , netting significant testimony from former Trump aide Tony Ornato and Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos in the final days of the committee ’ s investigation . In total , the committee grilled nearly every member of Trump ’ s inner circle . Some key witnesses pleaded their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination or invoked privileges the committee was unable to pierce . But others ,""]","[""The Jan. 6 select committee formally accused former President Donald Trump of four crimes: assisting an insurrection, obstructing Congress’ Jan. 6 joint session, conspiring to make false statements to the National Archives, and conspiring to defraud the United States. The panel believes the evidence demonstrates Trump provided “aid and comfort” to those storming the Capitol building in his bid to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat. Trump has not been officially charged with any crime relating to the Capitol riot. The select committee's final report, detailing their case against Trump, has been released but is yet to become public. Charging decisions ultimately rest with DOJ prosecutors, not Congress.

Es el momento de revisarlo más a fondo . Por Óscar Colorado Nates * Primera parte . El caso de Kevin Carter Kevin Carter , fotógrafo Kevin Carter nació en Johannesburgo , Sudáfrica , en 1960 . Creció rodeado por el estigma de la segregación racial en su país . Miembro de una familia de clase media en una localidad de raza blanca fue testigo , desde muy pequeño , de los arrestos que realizaba la policía a la gente negra que se encontraba en las áreas exclusivas para caucásicos . Carter era católico , y no acababa de comprender el problema de la discriminación racial en su país . In this July 3 , 1981 photo , anti-apartheid demonstrators march through Auckland , New Zealand to protest the tour of South Africa ’ s Springbok rugby union team . The tour had proceeded , in the face of bitter opposition from critics of South Africa ’ s system of apartheid or racial segregation ; with the sanction of the New Zealand Rugby Union and government of then Prime Minister Robert Muldoon . Few of the players who will wear the New Zealand or South African jerseys in Saturday ’ s , Sept. 12 , 2009 , Tri-Nations rugby test at Hamilton directly remember the last visit by the Springboks to this sedate North Island city . ( AP Photo/New Zealand Herald ) * * NEW ZEALAND OUT , FAIRFAX AUSTRALIA OUT * * Al terminar la educación media superior se unió a la fuerza aérea que abandonó por abuso . [ 1 ] Luego fue testigo del bombardeo de Church Street ocurrido en la ciudad capital de Pretoria en 1983 realizado por el ala paramilitar del Congreso Africano Nacional conocido como Umkhonto we Sizwe ( “ La lanza de la nación ” ) [ 2 ] . Por aquella época , Carter decidió dedicarse a la fotografía . [ 3 ] Primero trabajó como fotoperiodista deportivo en el Sunday Express y luego se unió al Johannesburg Star donde comenzó a cubrir la violencia durante el apartheid [ 4 ] y , eventualmente , llegaría a colaborar también con medios como el Sunday Tribune , el Weekly Mail o la agencia de imagen internacional Reuters . [ 5 ] Mudar de la fotografía deportiva a la imagen informativa implicaba un compromiso por cubrir temas serios , que podrían llegar a ser crudos e incluso terribles , ante un compromiso de buscar la verdad , denunciar la maldad e informar a la opinión pública en búsqueda del bien común . Además , en Sudáfrica se vivía un momento histórico angustiante y agudo , donde comenzaba la etapa de racismo más brutal propulsada por el Partido Nacional que había tomado las riendas del país en 1948 . Esta época terminaría hasta la subida al poder de Nelson Mandela en 1994 , y Carter registraría con su cámara las escenas más oscuras de aquel tiempo .

A company that I was in charge of.A castle on the hill that I built on my own.It was a dream I had since forever and now it had finally came true.Even though I wished I had some sort of a manual or a guide to lead me through the path of launching a new business , I now know that it wouldn‚Äôt be the same without the mistakes and the wrong turns that I did.The mistakes , wrong leads , impersonalised approach , the salesy lines were the things that made me who I am today.They made a solid ground for building a strong and agile business that evolved and grew along with them.And so did I.At first , of course , I needed some guidance.When I started using LinkedIn as my main business platform I did everything , and I really mean , everything wrong.I added tons of connections and I wrote to them all . And the saddest part about it was that I approached them all the same way . Without looking at the targeting options and job functions.What a rookie mistake.Little did I know that I needed to investigate my target first.And not only the target , but the industry the potential client was working in , their goals , the problems that this industry was facing and all the possible solutions I could offer them.First , of course , I needed to find out if we were a good match.I didn‚Äôt have the solution to just any problem they might have been facing.That only meant that I needed to listen to them.Yes , listening was a skill that I learned to master and it took me miles further from my starting point.And , then I had to learn to do targeting.But do it smartly.What is targeting ? Targeting is a foundational element of running a successful outreach campaign ‚Äî Getting your targeting right leads to higher engagement , and ultimately , higher conversion rates . By being active and reaching out on LinkedIn , you are getting your message in front of the right person when they are most engaged , and you can reach a potential professional network of more than 610 million members strong by leveraging accurate first-party data at scale . In this blog post , I wanted to show all of you how targeting on LinkedIn works and the different ways LinkedIn allows you to socially sell to those who matter most to your business.LinkedIn targeting is differentiated because members are incentivised to keep their profiles accurate and up-to-date for networking , personal branding , and job opportunities . With LinkedIn , you can reach a quality audience composed of influencers , decision makers , and executives.When members complete their LinkedIn profile , they provide information on their job experiences , company , skills , and more.This means you can target members using profile-based demographic information , re-target visitors from your website , or upload lists of contacts or companies for your account ‚Äì based marketing efforts.But how should you target positions ? Target positionsFinding the right people you need to approach is not an easy job . The first thing that you need to do is to find the most relevant positions for you , their official titles , variations in positions , etc.Working in the B2B sales world , one of the main challenges that I , and probably all business sales reps face is finding out who makes the buying decisions ‚Äì what to buy , when and from whom . What makes this process even trickier in comparison to B2C , is that usually there are more people involved . It‚Äôs not just one person that makes the buying call . So you need to target them all and see with whom you will click the best . When things come as far as outlining the marketing and sales process , what we need to do first is figure out whom with are we are going to talk to . Feel free to approach more people from the same department or even multiple people from different departments . But that being the case , you need to adjust your approach to each of these people individually . Since they are working together , they probably spend a lot of time together and they talk and share experiences . So imagine how you would look like in their eyes if you‚Äôve used the same lines on all of them . Oh , the embarrassment . After all , they are different people , different characters with different problems and concerns that you need to address.For example , let‚Äôs assume you are offering an HR software solution . Even though your first choice would be to target HR positions , you can expand your approach to : HR , Management , IT and Financial decision-makers . They all know their ways around things and have key roles and power to make and execute decisions . They are all problem-aware , solution-aware , and most probably are already using a software from your competition.Targeting each of these high ticket professionals requires a different approach . You should present how']","['The article discusses the importance of LinkedIn in business marketing, focusing on the practice of ""targeting"". The author, Dancho Dimkov, shares his journey of utilizing LinkedIn as a business platform, and talks about the mistakes he made when starting out, including not using LinkedIn\'s targeting options and job functions. In this context, the author explains ""targeting"" as reaching out to potential clients based on their job functions, industry, and goals. This involves researching the potential client and understanding the problems they face, then offering a solution tailored to their needs. He emphasizes the significance of sending personalized messages to potential clients using accurate, up-to-date data. He also suggests approaching multiple people from the same departments or different departments as all of them could be decision-makers. However, he cautions that it is crucial to adjust your approach to each individual. Dimkov recommends using LinkedIn profile-based demographic information, retargeting visitors from your website, or uploading lists of contacts or companies for your account-based marketing efforts.']"

The status code 400 accompanying the error indicates a ""Bad Request."" This outcome usually denotes that the request from the client to the server is incorrect or invalid, leading to unsuccessful retrieval of the tweet.\n\nSeveral reasons might trigger this error message. First, the request might incorrectly use Twitter API syntax or parameters. Second, the tweet ID one is attempting to access could be non-existent, either because the tweet was deleted or never existed in the first place. Third, the user might have been blocked by the account owner from which they are trying to retrieve a tweet.\n\nLastly, access problems could occur due to privacy settings or the API request might have exceeded its rate limit. Twitter places a restriction on the number of API requests from an app or user within a specific timeline to control and manage its server resources.\n\nTo address the issue, it is vital to check and correct the parameters sent in the request, affirm the existence of the tweet, and ensure the rate limit has not been exceeded. Also, seeking permission or unblocking from the account owner, if that\'s the case, might solve the problem. In cases where privacy settings or deleted content are the issue, retrieval might not be possible.']"

All rights reserved . Social media posts claim chicken and beef have been injected with prion proteins , nanoparticles or other material that make them stick to fridge magnets . But the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) says its surveillance measures guard against metallic contamination , while experts add that prions could not be responsible , and nanoparticles are not being added to meat . “ Don ’ t go to the store without your magnet , ” says a June 14 , 2021 Facebook post . Screenshot of a Facebook post taken June 16 , 2021 In the video , a man sticks a small round magnet onto the outside of a package of chicken . He says : “ They ’ re just putting little prions in here , ” suggesting that the prions -- an infectious protein -- are causing magnetic effects . Multiple posts making similar claims about a variety of packaged and unpackaged poultry and meat products can also be found on Instagram , where the most popular iteration has topped 40,000 views . Videos on YouTube and Tik Tok , as well as compilation videos , have further spread the claim . It comes after a series of false and misleading claims that linked Covid-19 vaccinations to magnetism spread around the world . These included a hoax , supposedly shown in videos , that people ’ s arms exhibit magnetic properties after they receive the shots . Other posts claim a variety of reasons as to why magnets may stick to the meat . One says , “ they are putting magnetic nano partials ( sic ) in our meat , ” while another claims “ they put heavy toxic metals in our food supply. ” Mick West , a British-American science writer , published a video on Metabunk.org , a website dedicated to debunking pseudoscience , demonstrating that magnets , coins , or other smooth objects will stick to various body parts , if one ’ s skin is slightly oily . “ Remove the oil and the object will not stick , ” he explains . For similar reasons , magnets might stick to meat and poultry “ due to the texture , angle or moisture of the product , ” the USDA told AFP . “ However , this does not mean that there is metal in the meat or poultry . All meat and poultry products bearing the USDA mark of inspection have been inspected for safety , wholesomeness , and accurate labeling , ” a USDA spokesperson said on June 21 , 2021 . The spokesperson added that all establishments inspected by USDA ’ s Food Safety and Inspection Service are required to have a system in place “ designed to prevent , eliminate , or reduce to acceptable levels any biological , chemical , or physical hazard that is reasonably likely to occur in the product. ” As a result , it is unlikely that an undetected piece of metal could contaminate meat products , the spokesperson said , with many establishments going so far as to “ install metal detectors and/or X-ray devices for screening their final products to ensure no accidental/unexpected metal ( shaving or a broken piece ) is present ” . FSIS personnel also conduct regular inspections . As for the social media claim that prions may be a magnetic component found in meat , “ this suggested hypothesis has no foundation in science , ” the USDA spokesperson said , adding : “ They are organic matter . More specifically , they are misfolded proteins . Therefore , they would lack any sort of magnetic quality. ” Prions have an association with meat through the most well-known prion disease , BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) -- also called mad cow disease -- which affects cattle and is believed to be related to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans . Dr James Mastrianni , a professor of neurology at University of Chicago Medicine , told AFP on June 17 , 2021 : “ There is some association of prions in meat , but these came from diseased cows being inadvertently used in the preparation of bovine-derived food . They were never purposely injected into meat , although how could anyone disprove such a crazy hypothesis ? “ Even if they were injected into meat , they are not magnetic and could certainly not perform the magic act of making a magnet stick to it. ” Some of the claims suggest that the phenomenon is caused by nanoparticles -- tiny materials invisible to the eye which can be of various types . Iron is a natural component of beef and other meats but Jaydee Hanson , policy director at the Center for Food Safety , an activist group , told AFP on June 21 , 2021 : “ While there is a remote chance that a powerful magnet could pick up on the magnetism of the iron in meat , it is really unlikely that most refrigerator magnets are that sensitive . “ As far as I know , no nano ingredients are being added to meats in the US. ” Natalie WADE All articles AFP USA All articles Follow us HomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrections Legal information']","[""AFP's Fact Check article addresses false claims spreading via social media suggesting that certain meat products contain substances that make them stick to magnets. Said substances are alleged to include prion proteins or nanoparticles. However, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) counters these claims, stating that its stringent measures prevent the presence of metallic contamination in meat. According to USDA representatives, claims that magnets stick to meat are likely due to the texture or moisture of the products rather than the presence of metal. As for the assertion that prions (misfolded proteins) could generate magnetic effects, this hypothesis is scientifically unfounded. The USDA added that monitored food establishments are required to have systems in place to combat potential hazards including foreign bodies such as metal pieces.""]"

Simply put , trans exclusion makes feminism weaker for trans and cis women alike . Here are some things you should know to make your feminism trans-inclusive : 1 . Trans women are women . When we say women , that word always includes trans women . There ’ s no ifs , ands or buts about it . A woman ’ s gender identity is her innermost concept of being female . A trans woman ’ s gender identity doesn ’ t define or caveat her womanhood , it simply describes her journey to womanhood . Play the Video : How Cis People Can Be Good Accomplices `` See me as you see your family member . See me as you see your newborn child . See me as you see yourself . '' 2 . Transphobia is offensive and harmful . Many policies that were created to target trans women and girls , from “ bathroom bills '' to anti-trans sports legislation , are super invasive for everyone . Bathroom bills , bills that aim to ban trans people from using the restrooms of their gender , ask women — all women — to prove their femininity . In one example , a cis woman was harassed and told to leave a Walmart bathroom because she was confused for a trans woman . This policy is offensive and embarrassing to anyone , especially women who don ’ t perform femininity in a “ traditional ” way . Anti-trans sports bills , bills that aim to bar trans women and girls from playing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity , also ask all women to prove their womanhood . Many bills that have been heard across the country go above and beyond to be invasive and harmful , some even going so far as to force kids to turn in doctor ’ s notes with proof of their genitalia . At the end of the day , anti-feminist ideology wants to police women ’ s bodies , and that includes trans women ’ s bodies . 3 . To be trans-inclusive is to be intersectional . Intersectionality is a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw , a Black American lawyer , civil rights advocate and leading scholar of critical race theory , to capture the complex , cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination ( such as racism , sexism and classism ) combine , overlap or intersect , especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups . It is also often used to refer to the ways in which we hold multiple intersecting identities at once ( e.g. , being a second-generation Nigerian-American , non-binary person ) . Feminism must account for all the unique and specific ways women are marginalized . This includes race , gender , sexuality and more . Racism informs transphobia , which then informs sexism and so on and so forth . It ’ s important to point out the ways in which transphobic ideas are rooted in racism . If one does not fit the mold of “ traditional femininity ” ( i.e . white , thin , etc . ) , one is other-ized and their womanhood is questioned . More often than not , the gender of women of color is delegitimized . This goes back centuries . You may remember learning about Sojourner Truth ’ s now-infamous speech entitled , “ Ain ’ t I A Woman. ” Through this , she argues that she is treated less than because she is Black and the way she is treated specifically targets her womanhood . Today , women of color in sports consistently have to prove their womanhood . Many elite athletes , like Dutee Chand and Caster Semenya , have been forced to provide evidence of their womanhood through invasively investigating their chromosomes and testosterone levels . This fight isn ’ t just against transphobia — it 's against racism , sexism and all the intersections . 4 . Trans women are feminist leaders . Black and Brown trans women are and have been the center of much of the social justice movement . Too often , the Black and Brown trans women who ignited today ’ s LGBTQ+ equality movement and feminism have been overlooked and their stories have been erased . And in instances where Black and Brown trans women are talked about in the media , it ’ s usually about their deaths or streams of misinformation that strip us of our dignity . 5 .

Status code: 429"" is an error message that generally occurs when a user or an application is trying to access Twitter\'s API (Application Programming Interface) too frequently. Status code 429 is essentially HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) response status code which denotes that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (""rate limiting"").\n\nTwitter, like many other online services, has implemented certain usage limits to safeguard their platform from potential abuse or even unintentional disruption by automated processes or bots. This limit is enforced on a per-user or per-application basis. The limits can apply to varied elements such as reading profile data, posting tweets, following or unfollowing users, etc.\n\nWhen those limits are exceeded, Twitter responds with the 429 status code, signaling that the user or the application needs to slow down and make fewer requests. This is not often a permanent block. Once the rate of requests is under Twitter\'s limit again, access to the services should resume as normal.\n\nThe message essentially acts as a warning to users and developers to adhere to Twitter\'s usage policies and to ensure that they do not unnecessarily stress the server with too many requests. If not rectified, this could lead to temporary or even permanent suspension of the user\'s access to Twitter\'s services. \n\nIn conclusion, it\'s a common error when working with APIs and requires strategic handling of API requests, implementing measures like using sleep or retry logic in coding, or upgrading to a more permissive access plan if available and necessary.']"

In 2014 , David S. Cohen , then United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence , accused Qatari authorities of allowing financiers who were on international blacklists to live freely in the country : `` There are U.S.- and UN-designated terrorist financiers in Qatar that have not been acted against under Qatari law . `` [ 1 ] Accusations come from a wide variety of sources including intelligence reports , government officials , and journalists . In response to these allegations , the Emir of Qatar , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani , in September 2014 went on US television to defend his government against claims that it harbors terrorist financiers .

He has since declined to accept the prize while the contest has remained silent on the matter . Berlin-based “ photomedia artist ” Boris Eldagsen participated this year in the World Photography Organization ’ s Sony World Photography Awards , a leading photo contest that offers prizes that include $ 5,000 cash , Sony camera equipment , a trip to London for the awards ceremony , and/or worldwide publicity through a book and exhibition . Eldagsen submitted an image titled THE ELECTRICIAN to the Creative category of the 2023 Open competition . It picture appears to be a portrait of two women captured with a photographic process from the early days of photography . “ THE ELECTRICIAN ” by Boris Eldagsen . The photo is part of a series titled PSEUDOMNESIA : Fake Memories that Eldagsen has been working on since 2022 . “ PSEUDOMNESIA is the Latin term for pseudo memory , a fake memory , such as a spurious recollection of events that never took place , as opposed to a memory that is merely inaccurate , ” the artist writes on the project page . “ The following images have been co-produced by the means of AI ( artificial intelligence ) image generators . “ Using the visual language of the 1940s , Boris Eldagsen produces his images as fake memories of a past , that never existed , that no one photographed . These images were imagined by language and re-edited more between 20 to 40 times through AI image generators , combining ‘ inpainting ’ , ‘ outpainting ’ , and ‘ prompt whispering ’ techniques . “ Just as photography replaced painting in the reproduction of reality , AI will replace photography . Don ’ t be afraid of the future . It will just be more obvious that our mind always created the world that makes it suffer. ” 1st Prize in the Creative Category The photo went on to not only be shortlisted in the Creative category , but judges selected it as the overall winner of that category . When the winners in the Open Competition were announced on March 14th , Eldagsen took to his blog to share his views of the win and of AI . “ I am very happy that I won the creative category of Sony World Photography Awards 2023 / Open Competition / Single Image , ” he wrote last month . “ I have been photographing since 1989 , been a photomedia artist since 2000 . After two decades of photography , my artistic focus has shifted to exploring the creative possibilities of AI generators. ” “ The work SWPA [ Sony World Photography Awards ] has chosen is the result of a complex interplay of prompt engineering , inpainting , and outpainting that draws on my wealth of photographic knowledge . For me , working with AI image generators is a co-creation , in which I am the director . It is not about pressing a button – and done it is . It is about exploring the complexity of this process , starting with refining text prompts , then developing a complex workflow , and mixing various platforms and techniques . The more you create such a workflow and define parameters , the higher your creative part becomes . Eldagsen says that he calls his work “ images ” and not “ photographs ” since they are “ synthetically produced , using ‘ the photographic ’ as a visual language. ” He also says that he is trying to bring this distinction to the forefront in the photo contest industry so that separate awards can be created for AI images . “ Participating in open calls , I want to speed up the process of the Award organizers to become aware of this difference and create separate competitions for AI-generated images , ” the artist says . Eldagsen ’ s win has been controversial , with photographers bemoaning the fact that an image created without any camera or light managed to take a top photography prize over actual photographers . Refusal of the Prize Eldagsen added a note to his website yesterday announcing that he was refusing the award and prize of Sony camera equipment . In an open letter to the contest ’ s organizers , the artist explained that the whole thing had been an experiment and effort to accelerate the conversation about this subject . “ Thank you for selecting my image and making this a historic moment , as it is the first AI-generated image to win in a prestigious international PHOTOGRAPHY competition , ” Eldagsen writes . “ How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated ? Something about this doesn ’ t feel right , does it ? “ AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this . They are different entities . AI is not photography . Therefore I will not accept the award. ” Eldagsen and his award-winning image .

This error is returned when the user exceeds certain limitations set by the server, such as the number of requests per second or the total number of requests in a certain time period.\n\nIn the context of retrieving tweets, this error can arise due to various reasons. For instance, one may be utilizing an application or a service that uses Twitter\'s Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve tweets and other relevant data. Twitter\'s API has rate limits on the number of requests that can be made within particular timeframes to prevent misuse and maintain the service\'s performance and reliability.\n\nHence, the error points out that the user has either made too many requests within a short period or the application they are using has surpassed Twitter\'s rate limits. The users need to wait for some time before making more requests to resolve this issue. It is meant to control the frequency of interactions with the server in order to prevent it from becoming overloaded.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement ""Failed to retrieve tweet.

Read our privacy noticeBoris Johnson has criticised the planned closure of a police station in his constituency – despite it being shut as part of a policy he introduced as Mayor of London.The Foreign Secretary said he was “ very disappointed ” and “ mystified ” at the decision by the Mayor ’ s Office for Policing and Crime to close the station in Uxbridge.He wrote on Twitter : “ Very disappointed and mystified at closure of Uxbridge Police Station . Fully support Hillingdon Conservative ’ s [ sic ] call for rethink. ” However , the policy of closing local police stations was introduced in 2013 , when Mr Johnson was Mayor . Under the plans , 65 police stations across London were earmarked for closure , leaving just one publicly-accessible station in each borough.Officials say the vast majority of crimes are now reported online or over the phone , making front desks at police stations redundant.At the time , Mr Johnson said : “ Londoners have repeatedly told us that putting more officers on the streets is their top priority , not keeping them hidden behind desks in offices which the public rarely set foot in. ” RecommendedTory rising star challenges Boris Johnson ’ s foreign policy strategyOn another occasion he said : “ Sometimes I think police front counters haven ’ t been well used . People don ’ t want to report a crime there. “ A lot of people find a police station intimidating . They are becoming less and less central to our thinking. ” Mr Johnson ’ s then Deputy Mayor for Policing , Stephen Greenhalgh , said in 2013 : “ We have to accept that the old-fashioned front counter provision is probably not the solution for the 21st Century. ” The policy of closing police stations was continued by the current Mayor , Sadiq Khan , in an attempt to save £400 million by 2021 . As part of this , Uxbridge police station in Mr Johnson ’ s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency is set to shut.Labour politicians rushed to point out that it was Mr Johnson ’ s own policy that was to blame for the potential closure.Alice Perry , an Islington councillor and member of Labour ’ s National Executive Committee ( NEC ) , said : “ When Boris Johnson was Mayor he lavished money on vanity projects while cutting community policing and closing police and fire stations. ” Sadiq Khan 's 5 most significant policiesShow all 51/5Sadiq Khan 's 5 most significant policiesSadiq Khan 's 5 most significant policiesTackle the housing crisisKhan ’ s key policy is an ambitious target to make 50 per cent of all new homes being genuinely affordable , and improving conditions for people rentingGetty ImagesSadiq Khan 's 5 most significant policiesFreeze transport faresKhan says he will freeze London transport fares for four years and introduce a one-hour bus ‘ Hopper ’ ticket , paid for by making TfL more efficient and exploring new revenue-raising opportunities .

The survey , released by Gallup on Thursday , found that just 37 % of US adults approved of the 80-year-old president ’ s job performance , the lowest the polling outfit has measured since the start of his presidency . Gallup found that 59 % of adults said they disapproved of the job Biden has done as commander in chief . The poll was conducted between April 3-25 . It was completed on the day Biden announced he would seek a second term in office . Biden ’ s approval rating has been measured in the low 40 % range for most of the last 19 months , according to the polling company , and the last time it was this low was in July 2022 , when 38 % said they disapproved of his job performance . His latest approval rating marks a three-point decline from March and a five-point dip from February . Over the recently completed ninth quarter of Biden ’ s presidency – Jan. 20 through April 19 – his job approval average has been measured at 39.7 % by Gallup , which is the lowest quarterly average of his first term and lower than former President Donald Trump ’ s 41.6 % approval rating average in the same quarter . Biden ’ s 31 % approval from independents ties his lowest rating from that cohort , and is 9 points lower than it was in February . Gallup ’ s survey found only 37 % of US adults approve of the job Biden is doing as president . Polaris Gallup found that Biden ’ s nosediving job approval numbers correspond with the increasingly pessimistic views American ’ s hold on the economy . The poll found that only 16 % of those surveyed rate the economy as excellent or good , while 47 % describe it as poor – up from 43 % who said the same in March – and 75 % say it is getting worse . Biden formally announced his bid for re-election on Tuesday , asking voters to give him and Vice President Kamala Harris another four years to help him “ finish the job. ” The country ’ s oldest president in history made the decision to seek a second term despite polls showing that the majority of Americans , and most Democrats , don ’ t want him to run again in 2024 . Biden would be 86-years-old by the end of a second term in the White House .

This hack beats grease for longer These Gen Z slang terms are totally outdated , according to Gen Alpha : ‘ What does that even mean ? ’ The Biden administration is tapping prominent TikTokers and other social media influencers to help court young voters as the Democrat gears up for reelection , according to a report . The digital strategy team for President Biden is connecting with hundreds of influencers across the country who would promote the 80-year-old ’ s record in the Oval Office to help draw in voters , ages 18 to 29 , who don ’ t already follow the White House or the Democratic Party on various online platforms , Axios reported . The effort is reportedly spearheaded by staffer Rob Flaherty , who will lead four digital staffers in the White House and was named assistant to the president , which has the same rank as the communication director and press secretary . Reaching young voters is so critical to Biden that social media influencers – who are unpaid – could have their own briefing room inside the White House to work in-person or remotely , according to Axios . “ We actually asked the White House , ‘ When are we going to get press briefing passes , ’ ” 20-year-old TikToker Harry Sisson told the outlet . “ They were actually were very responsive to it. ” The NYU student has more than 663,000 followers on TikTok and delivers a brief report day ’ s biggest news events on the platform . The White House also reportedly plans to connect with influencers who have local followings when Biden travels to a certain state . Social media influencer Harry Sisson @ harryjsisson Ironically , the push comes the same time the White House has signaled its willingness to sign off on legislation that would ban TikTok or force its sale because of the platform owner ’ s ties to the Chinese government and fears it has access to the platform ’ s user data .

The clip of Biden ’ s answers , where he touted making more electric cars , was seen 38 million times on TikTok . “ We ’ re trying to reach young people , but also moms who use different platforms to get information and climate activists and people whose main way of getting information is digital , ” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jen O ’ Malley told Axios .

We are . Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightIn addition to the Oval Office meeting , the TikTok creators held a session with former president Barack Obama , toured the Supreme Court and the Capitol , and met with leaders of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , the principal campaign arm for House Democrats.The trip , which was organized by the DNC , was the most visible effort to date of Democrats attempting to leverage TikTok ’ s vast audience to influence the midterms and is likely to prove controversial with Republicans , many of whom have been harshly critical of TikTok ’ s Chinese ownership . Former president Donald Trump at one point ordered TikTok to be shut down in the United States , then tried to force the sale of its U.S. operations . Those efforts failed , however , though Republicans have continued to accuse the app of being a threat.AdvertisementSince then , TikTok has been downloaded more than 100 million times by users in the United States , and it has surpassed Meta ’ s Facebook and Instagram to become the nation ’ s fastest-growing social media app.How TikTok ate the internet “ House Democrats are committed to reaching voters where they ’ re at and reminding them what ’ s at stake on November 8th , ” said Cara Koontz , the DCCC ’ s digital communications director . “ We ’ re thrilled to have their partnership in this first-of-its-kind effort for the DCCC. ” It remains to be seen how the creators will make use of the visit . Many had previously been largely apolitical , encouraging their fans to vote but not explicitly backing parties or candidates . For several , it was their first time in the nation ’ s capital and their first interaction with government. “ I think they brought me in as a fairly independent , attempting to be a nonpartisan , creator who did not vote for Obama , ” said V Spehar , host of Under the Desk News , a TikTok news channel with 2.7 million followers.It was clear during the visit that while their names and faces might be unknown to many in Washington political circles , that did not hold true for all . A kickoff dinner at We , The Pizza on Capitol Hill became so chaotic with swarms of young fans snapping photos and asking to take TikTok videos with the creators that the staff soon cleared an upstairs space so the stars could dine in peace.AdvertisementThe dinner conversation focused on issues like reproductive rights and strategizing how to best leverage their audiences for the midterms , several attendees said. “ We felt very excited , very optimistic , ” Spehar said . “ A lot of the creators talked about how they didn ’ t get a lot of civics education in school . They were excited to learn about the structure of government and see it in person. ” That lack of familiarity with government also apparently applied to their audiences . After the group solicited questions about the midterms on Instagram Stories , one influencer , Nia Sioux , 21 , an actress and creator with 8.3 million followers on TikTok , realized her young followers were confused by references to midterms in her posts .

The campaign is reportedly spearheaded by Rob Flaherty, who is overseeing four digital staffers at the White House.

But did you know that America had other versions of intelligence agencies before CIA was formed ? Explore our rich history.BeforeWorld War IIA Siloed Approach to Foreign IntelligenceThe history of America ’ s foreign intelligence gathering reaches back to the Revolutionary war . But it wasn ’ t until World War II that our country ’ s foreign intelligence activities were coordinated government-wide.Before the war , the Department of State , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , and the U.S. Armed Services were collecting intelligence with no direction or coordination.1941July 11The Office of the Coordinator of InformationFrustrated by the piecemeal , stove-piped information he was receiving , President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Office of the Coordinator of Information ( COI ) . Led by World War I hero General William “ Wild Bill ” Donovan , COI ’ s main goal was to gather foreign intelligence related to the War.As World War II progressed , Donovan and President Roosevelt reevaluated COI ’ s size , organization , and mission . At Donovan ’ s suggestion , President Roosevelt transformed COI into a new office with a title that reflected the importance of strategy in intelligence gathering and clandestine operations.General William “ Wild Bill ” Donovan , the “ father of American intelligence ” and head of the Office of Strategic Services . 1942June 13The Office of Strategic ServicesOften referred to as our Agency ’ s forerunner , the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) became the first centralized intelligence agency in American history.Wild Bill Donovan led the women and men of OSS to collect and analyze strategic information and conduct unconventional and paramilitary operations.Though the new office met some resistance from other U.S. agencies , OSS continued to grow its world-wide intelligence capabilities through military , diplomatic , and non-official cover . At its peak , OSS employed over 13,000 military personnel and civilians—35 % of whom were women.OSS existed for just over three years , but in this time it made a lasting contribution to our country , the world , and the future of American intelligence.1945October 1The Strategic Services UnitAt the end of World War II , President Harry S. Truman abolished OSS along with many other war agencies . This left the Nation without a non-departmental , strategically oriented intelligence service.On President Truman ’ s order , branches of OSS merged into a new office , the Strategic Services Unit ( SSU ) . SSU took a temporary role filling former OSS posts across the globe until the United States could put a more permanent solution into place.1946January 22The Central Intelligence GroupEarly in the new year , Administration officials decided to move SSU ’ s duties and responsibilities to the newly created Central Intelligence Group ( CIG ) . Unlike previous organizations of its kind , CIG was granted the authority to conduct independent research and analysis . This meant CIG could move beyond simply coordinating intelligence to producing intelligence.President Truman chose Rear Admiral Sidney Souers , the deputy chief of Naval Intelligence at the end of World War II , to lead the CIG , making Souers the first person to hold the title of Director of Central Intelligence ( DCI ) .Within months of its creation , CIG became the nation ’ s primary agency for strategic warning and management of clandestine activities abroad . However , it was constrained by the Department of State and the armed services . President Truman soon recognized the need for a new , fully-functional post-war intelligence organization . So , in 1947 he signed the National Security Act , establishing the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .Rear Admiral Sidney Souers , head of CIG and the first person to officially hold the title Director of Central Intelligence . 1947September 18The Central Intelligence AgencyThe National Security Act of 1947 established CIA as an independent , civilian intelligence agency within the executive branch . The Act charged CIA with coordinating the Nation ’ s intelligence activities and , among other duties , collecting , evaluating , and disseminating intelligence affecting national security.The Act also created a Director of Central Intelligence , or DCI , to lead both CIA and the U.S. Intelligence Community . The DCI also served as the president ’ s main adviser on all intelligence matters . President Truman appointed former CIG Deputy Director , Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter , to be the first to lead the new Agency . One third of the CIA ’ s personnel were OSS veterans.Two years later , President Truman signed the Central Intelligence Agency Act . This legislation allowed CIA to secretly fund intelligence operations and develop personnel procedures outside standard U.S. government practices.By 1953 , the Agency was an established element of the U.S. government . Its contributions in the areas of political action and paramilitary warfare were recognized and respected . CIA had grown six times in these six years , and set up three of the five directorates we have today.As the Agency continued to grow , employees moved from offices in Washington , DC , to a new headquarters in Langley , Virginia . The Original Headquarters Building was the first home designed specifically for Agency officers . Today , CIA Headquarters still serves as an iconic symbol of our Agency and our mission.Roscoe Hillenkoetter , the first Director of the newly created Central Intelligence Agency . 2004December 17The Intelligence Community RestructuresThe role of the DCI changed in 2004 , when President George W.

I'll be delighted to help with that!"", 'The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is an independent U.S. Government agency responsible for providing national security intelligence to senior U.S. policymakers. Its history traces back to World War II, with the formation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which gathered foreign intelligence relevant to the war. However, lack of coordination led to its transformation into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) under the leadership of General William ""Wild Bill"" Donovan. The OSS was the first centralized American intelligence Agency. It was dissolved after the war, leading to the Strategic Services Unit (SSU), a temporary solution that covered former OSS posts worldwide. The SSU evolved into the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), which could not only coordinate but also produce intelligence. In 1947, the National Security Act established the CIA as an independent, civilian intelligence agency. The Act also created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). By 1953, the agency was fully institutionalized, growing six times in size, setting up three main directorates and moving to a new headquarters in Virginia.\n']"

Status code: 429"" is an error notification that occurs when attempting to fetch a tweet, probably through an API request, and the process doesn\'t succeed. This could have been due to multiple reasons.\n\nA significant aspect of this issue is the status code 429. HTTP status codes are responses from the server to the client\'s request. The status code 429 means \'Too Many Requests\'. It indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. It\'s a message from the server indicating that the client is being rate-limited.\n\nIn context with Twitter, Twitter\'s API has rate limits applied per user and per application to ensure that there isn\'t an abuse of their services. This error specifically suggests that the application or client has breached Twitter’s API rate limit. \n\nIf you\'re using Twitter’s API, it\'s important to note the limitations set by Twitter to prevent exceeding the limit. Once the rate limit is exceeded, no more requests can be made within that time frame, which is likely what has caused the tweet retrieval to fail in this case. It\'s recommended to appropriately manage and plan API calls to avoid this.\n\nAs a resolution, once the rate limit window resets, requests can be resumed. The user may also need to consider optimizing their API calls, spreading their requests more evenly to avoid hitting this limit or, if the demand is high, potentially upgrading to premium or enterprise level to increase the available rate limits.']"

Since this type of attack had not been conducted before , the drone was an unassuming place for the Islamic State to hide an improvised explosive device . But that trick only works occasionally , and it likely has a limited shelf life . Creativity and innovation , however , don ’ t appear to be problems for the Islamic State . Several days ago , on January 24 , 2017 , the group ’ s media office for Ninawa province released a video entitled “ The Knights of the Dawawin , ” which highlighted a new Islamic State drone capability : dropping small bomb-like munitions on its enemies from the air.2 The capability displayed was not a one-off achievement as in scene after scene the video shows the group dropping small bombs from remotely controlled drones and doing so with some level of relative accuracy . This included the Islamic State being able to successfully drop munitions onto crowds and to hit stationary vehicles and tanks while its drone loitered and filmed the incidents . Besides the surprise factor observed from those being targeted by the Islamic State ’ s drones , the video also showed that the group ’ s new capability packed enough punch to wound and/or kill those near where the munition landed . And on January 30 , the Wilayat al-Furat media office released a video entitled “ Roar of the Lions ” in which the Islamic State featured its military operations in the Anbar Province of Iraq . At the end of the video , the group showed a brief teaser for its next release , which contained a video clip of the drone bomb drop capability ( this time with what appeared to be a round grenade ) being used in Anbar . Despite these achievements , it is also important to remember that the videos released by the Islamic State are edited pieces of propaganda , which likely have been carefully crafted to make the group—and its capabilities—look impressive . What isn ’ t being shown are all of the times U.S. and Iraqi forces have downed the Islamic State ’ s quad-copters3 or instances when the Islamic State ’ s new drone bomb drop tool were less accurate . Screen capture from Islamic State video showing a drone munition drop targeting a tank The recent discovery of a small batch of internal Islamic State documents , which were recovered in Iraq and provided to the Combating Terrorism Center ( CTC ) , provides an inside look into how the group has sought to cobble together , develop , and enhance its drone capabilities as well as manage its drone program . The paragraphs below provide a description of the documents and an overview of their significance in light of what is already known about the Islamic State ’ s use of drones . The Documents : Background and Caveats The documents reviewed for this analysis were provided to the CTC by Vera Mironova , a research fellow at the Belfer Center at Harvard University . Ms. Mironova personally obtained hard copies of the documents while she was conducting field research in Iraq , embedded with an Iraqi military unit . The documents were discovered in a facility formerly under the control of the Islamic State located in the Muhandeseen neighborhood of Mosul , near Mosul University . Drones at Islamic State drone facility in Mosul , Iraq ( Vera Mironova ) While confirming authenticity of these types of documents is always a challenge , the authors believe they are real given the location and circumstances of their acquisition , the nature of the documents , and the CTC ’ s experience working with a wide array of captured battlefield material . All of the documents appear to be from the 2015 time period , and the collection includes a mix of official Islamic State forms and handwritten notes . The 21 documents themselves can be broken down into']","[""This extensive research report discusses the development of the Islamic State's drone programme, its capabilities and management, and potential implications. Drones have played a relatively recent yet significant role in the organisation’s operations, allowing it to drop small, bomb-like munitions from the air. However, the report notes that, while the successful use of drones can have significant impact, many attempts often fail or are less accurate than depicted. The report is built on a collection of documents discovered in Mosul, which provide an inside look into the organization's attempts to develop and enhance its drone capabilities. However, the precise authenticity of these documents remains unconfirmed, although they are assumed to be genuine.""]"

En recuerdo a los colores del cantón suizo de donde era originario , Gamper escogió el azul y grana . Así nació un mito , el club donde jugaron Kubala , Suárez , Cruyff , Maradona y hoy Ronaldinho . El `` Barça '' a lo largo del siglo XX se ha convertido en un símbolo de Barcelona y Cataluña , en donde los catalanes han proyectado su identidad como nación . Por esta razón decimos que el `` Barça '' es más que un club . NACE EL MITO El 29 de noviembre de 1899 , en la sede del Gimnasio Solé , Joan Gamper se reunió con Gualteri Wild , Lluís d'Ossó , Bartomeu Terrados , Otto Kunzle , Otto Maier , Enric Ducal , Pere Cabot , Carles Pujol , Josep Llobet , John Parsons y William Parsons . Once deportistas que se reunieron para fundar un club de fútbol . Gualteri Wild fue nombrado primer presidente . El primer parido que jugaron fue en el velódromo de la Bonanova , y jugaron con un combinado que ingleses residentes en Barcelona que ganaron por 0-1.Pasando por diversos escenarios , el 14 de marzo de 1909 el Club inauguró su primer campo propio en la calle Industria con alojamiento para 6000 personas . En esta época el Barcelona consigue sus primeros éxitos : Campeonato de Cataluña de 1909-10 , 1910-11 , 1912-13 , 1915-16 , 1918-19 1919-20 , 1920-21 y 1921-22 y los Campeonato de España de 1909-10 , 1911-12 , 1912-13 , 1919-20 y 1921-22 . EL CAMPO DE LES CORTS El 20 de mayo de 1922 se inaugura del campo de Les Corts , también conocido como 'La Catedral del fútbol ' , un estadio con capacidad para 30.000 espectadores que después de diferentes proyectos llego hasta los 60.000 . En el 1924 el club ya tenia 12.207 socios y un amplio número de aficionados que pusieron las bases de la masa social actual . La temporada 1928-29 se celebra la primera edición de la liga española , que ganará el Barça cerrando de forma brillante una época repleta de títulos . LOS AÑOS 30 Joan Gamper morirá el 30 de julio de 1930 . Este mal comienzo de la década , fue un mal augurio que se confirmo en sucesivas crisis institucionales : bajas de socios , malos resultados deportivos y la presión política de los franquistas . La Guerra Civil de 1936 tiene consecuencias funestas para la entidad . Josep Suñol , presidente del Club es asesinado por los soldados franquistas cerca de Guadalajara , sin embargo la entidad continua viva y en el 36 el Barça hace una gira por Méjico y Estados Unidos que salva la economía del Club . En marzo del 1938 , una bomba lanzada por los fascistas sobre la sede social del FC Barcelona provoca graves destrozos . Ya en el 39 , las tropas franquistas crean muchos problemas para el Club que se ha convertido en un símbolo de los catalanes , aunque en aquel momento , tan sólo le quedaban 3.486 socios .. LA COPA LATINA En la década de los cuarenta el Barça , poco a poco , va renaciendo de sus cenizas a pesar de las dificultades coyunturales . En junio del 1943 , acontece el escándalo de Chamartín , una derrota sufrida en terreno madridista condicionada por las amenazas arbitrales y policiales , que provoca la renuncia de Piñeiro , el presidente franquista , pero honesto . Llegan tiempos mejores y se ganan las Ligas 1944-45 , 1947-48 y 1948-49 y de la Copa Latina de 1949 , una competición precedente de la Copa de Europa que es el primer éxito internacional del FC Barcelona . Estamos en la época de César , Basora , Velasco , Curta , los hermanos Gonzalvo , Seguer , Biosca o Ramallets . El Barça celebra 50 años y tiene 24.893 socios KUBALA Ladislao Kubala llego a Barcelona en junio de 1950 , convirtiendo al FC Barcelona en un equipo intratable gracias a una delantera mágica : Basora , César , Kubala , Moreno y Manchón . Entre 1951 y 1953 , el Barça gana todas las competiciones en las que participa ( Ligas 1951-52 y 1952-53 y las Copas 1950-51 1951-52 y 1952-53 ) .

侮辱行為で相手を訴えるには、相手を侮辱罪などで刑事告訴する方法と、相手に対して損害賠償請求をする方法が存在します。 今回は、侮辱行為をした相手を訴える方法などについて、弁護士がくわしく解説します。 目次侮辱罪とは誹謗中傷に対してとりうる法的措置侮辱罪で相手を訴える方法と流れ侮辱罪で相手を訴える際のポイントまとめ ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。

侮辱罪とは、「事実を摘示しなくても、公然と人を侮辱した者」が該当する罪です（刑法231条）。 まず、「事実を適示しなくても」という点が、事実の適示が必要である「名誉毀損罪」と大きく異なる点です。 つまり、たとえば「バカ」や「ブス」など抽象的な表現であっても、侮辱罪に該当する可能性があります。 なお、どの程度ひどい言葉であれば侮辱罪に該当するなどの明確な線引きがあるわけではありません。 侮辱罪にあたるかどうかは、経緯や内容によって、総合的に判断されます。 また、侮辱罪が成立するためには、「公然と」侮辱したことが必要です。 そのため、他者がいない密室で行われた侮辱行為や他者が見ることのできない個別メッセージでの侮辱行為などは、原則として侮辱罪に問えないこととなります。 一方、SNSやインターネット上の掲示板への投稿、ブログのコメント欄への投稿などでされた侮辱行為などは誰もが見ることができるため、侮辱罪の成立要件を満たす可能性が高いでしょう。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。 0120-002-489電話でお問合せ 24時間受付、通話無料 お問合せフォームへ 24時間受付、簡単入力 弁護士費用を確認する 誹謗中傷に対してとりうる法的措置 相手から侮辱などの誹謗中傷を受けた場合には、どのような法的措置が検討できるのでしょうか？ 相手に対してとりうる主な法的措置は、次のとおりです。 なお、相手の刑法上の罪に問うための刑事告訴と民事上の責任を取らせるための損害賠償請求は、いずれか一方のみを行うことも可能ですし、両方の措置をとることも可能です。 両方を行うべきかいずれか一方を行うべきかは、相手の行為の態様や侮辱された側が何を求めているかなどによって異なりますので、あらかじめ弁護士へご相談いただいたうえ検討するとよいでしょう。 刑法上の罪に問う 1つめの方法は、相手を刑法上の罪に問うことです。 侮辱罪や名誉毀損罪は、告訴がなければ起訴することができない「親告罪」であるため、相手を刑法上の罪に問うためには、刑事告訴をしなければなりません。 また、脅迫罪は親告罪ではないものの、相手を罪に問いたい場合には、刑事告訴をした方がよいでしょう。 侮辱行為が該当する可能性のある主な罪には、次のものなどが存在します。 侮辱罪 先ほど解説したように、侮辱罪とは「事実を摘示しなくても、公然と人を侮辱した者」が該当する罪です。 公開の場で抽象的な悪口を言われた場合には、こちらを検討することとなります。 侮辱罪の法定刑は、「1年以下の懲役もしくは禁錮もしくは30万円以下の罰金または拘留もしくは科料」です。 以前は「拘留または科料」のみでしたが、インターネット上での誹謗中傷が社会問題となっていることを受け、2022年7月7日より厳罰化されました。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。

なお、ここでいう「事実」とは「本当のこと」という意味ではなく、「具体的な内容を適示する」という意味合いです。 たとえば、「〇田太郎氏は裏口入学だ」などとSNSに記載することは、名誉毀損罪に該当し得るということです。 ただし、公益目的である等一定の要件を満たす場合には、罰せられないとされています。 また、侮辱罪と同じく「公然と」行うことが要件とされているため、他者が見ることのできない個別メッセージなどでの発言を名誉毀損罪に問うことは原則として難しいでしょう。 名誉毀損罪の法定刑は、「3年以下の懲役もしくは禁錮または50万円以下の罰金」です。 脅迫罪 脅迫罪とは、相手や相手の親族の「生命、身体、自由、名誉、又は財産に対し害を加える旨を告知して人を脅迫した者」が該当する罪です（同222条）。 こちらは「公然と」などは要件とされていませんので、たとえば個別メッセージで「殺してやる」などと送った場合などにも、脅迫罪が成立する可能性があります。 脅迫罪の法定刑は、「2年以下の懲役または30万円以下の罰金」です。 損害賠償請求をする もう1つの方法は、相手に対して損害賠償請求（慰謝料請求）をすることです。 こちらは民事上の請求であり、警察や検察は関係ありません。 なお、民事上の損害賠償請求が認められるための要件は、刑事上の侮辱罪などの成立要件と重なる部分もあるものの、同一ではありません。 刑法上の侮辱罪では有罪とならなかった場合であっても、損害賠償請求が認められる可能性があります。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。

後述のように、侮辱行為を受けたら、まずは侮辱されたことの証拠を残しましょう。 いくら侮辱されたことを主張しても、証拠がなければ相手に対して損害賠償請求をすることや相手を侮辱の罪に問うことは困難となるためです。 そのうえで、早期に弁護士へご相談ください。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。 0120-002-489電話でお問合せ 24時間受付、通話無料 お問合せフォームへ 24時間受付、簡単入力 弁護士費用を確認する 情報開示請求をする 相手に対して損害賠償請求をしたい場合には、これらに先立って、相手が誰であるのかを特定しなければなりません。 相手が誰であるのかわからなければ、損害賠償請求をすることができないためです。 なお、刑事告訴を行う場合も、先に相手が誰であるのかを特定することが多いです。 情報開示請求は多くの場合、コンテンツプロバイダ（X（旧Twitter）社など）への請求とアクセスプロバイダ（NTTなど）への請求の、二段階で必要になります。 なぜなら、コンテンツプロバイダは投稿者の氏名や住所までの正確な情報を持っていないことが少なくないためです。 そのため、第一段階として、まずコンテンツプロバイダから相手のIPアドレスやタイムスタンプなどの開示を受けます。 これらの情報をもとに、第二段階としてアクセスプロバイダに開示請求を行い、ようやくアクセスプロバイダの契約者の住所と氏名が判明するという流れです。 ただし、コンテンツプロバイダやアクセスプロバイダに直接開示請求をしたところで、任意で開示される可能性は小さいのが実際です。 侮辱投稿をした相手の情報も個人情報である以上、任意での開示には大きなリスクが伴うためです。 そのため、裁判所に発信者情報開示命令の申立てを行い、裁判所から発信者情報開示命令を出してもらう手続きが必要となります。 なお、発信者情報開示のための裁判手続きは、これまでコンテンツプロバイダへの請求手続きとアクセスプロバイダへの請求手続きを1つずつ分けて行う必要がありました。 しかし、これでは多大な手間と時間を要することから、2022年10月1日から施行された改正により、2つの開示請求を1つの手続きでまとめて行えることとなっています。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。 0120-002-489電話でお問合せ 24時間受付、通話無料 お問合せフォームへ

損害賠償請求をする（民事上の責任を問いたい場合） 侮辱投稿をした相手に対して損害賠償請求をしたい場合には、相手に対して内容証明郵便を送るなどして損害賠償請求をします。 相手から減額の申し入れなどがされる場合もありますので、あらかじめ妥協点を検討しておくとよいでしょう。 相手が任意での支払いに応じない場合には、訴訟により請求することとなります。 侮辱行為で認められる損害賠償額は通常数万円から数十万円程度です。 そのため、あらかじめ弁護士へご相談のうえ、金額の想定をしておくとよいでしょう。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。 0120-002-489電話でお問合せ 24時間受付、通話無料 お問合せフォームへ 24時間受付、簡単入力 弁護士費用を確認する 侮辱罪で相手を訴える際のポイント 侮辱罪で相手を訴えるには、どのような点に注意すればよいのでしょうか？ 主なポイントは、次のとおりです。 証拠を残す 侮辱罪で相手を訴えるには、まず侮辱行為の証拠を残すことが重要です。 インターネット上で侮辱をされた場合には、次の内容などがわかる画面のスクリーンショットを残しましょう。 侮辱された投稿 相手のアカウント名やユーザー名 投稿のURL 投稿の日時 誹謗中傷問題に強い弁護士に相談をする 誹謗中傷への対応を、自分で行うことはおすすめできません。 相手と直接交渉をした結果、誹謗中傷が激化したり、売り言葉に買い言葉となり相手にとって有利な証拠を残してしまうリスクもあります。 また、発信者情報の開示には相当の理由が必要であり、やみくもに請求をしたところで開示が認められるものではありません。 法的な根拠が不足したままでは開示請求が認められない可能性があるほか、手続に多大な労力を要してしまう可能性もあるでしょう。 そのため、自分を侮辱した相手を訴えたい場合には、誹謗中傷問題に強い弁護士に早期にご相談ください。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。 0120-002-489電話でお問合せ

また、相手が投稿やアカウントを消して、証拠隠滅をはかる可能性もあります。 そのため、インターネット上での誹謗中傷への法的措置をとるためには、対応のスピードがカギとなります。 ささいなお悩みもお気軽にお問合せください 初回相談60分無料※一部例外がございます。 オペレーターが弁護士とのご相談日程を調整いたします。 0120-002-489電話でお問合せ 24時間受付、通話無料 お問合せフォームへ

Ager-Hanssen took to social media on September 30 , 2023 , to detail the reasons behind his departure , highlighting a series of serious concerns he reported to the nChain board . Among these , he alleged a conspiracy to defraud nChain shareholders orchestrated by a significant shareholder and raised concerns about the ultimate beneficiary shareholder and the real individuals behind DW Discovery fund registered in Cayman . The former CEO also mentioned that the chairman had been taking instructions from shadow directors , which he found unacceptable . Evidence against Dr. Craig Wright A notable part of Ager-Hanssen ’ s revelation was his assertion that he had discovered compelling evidence against Dr. Craig Wright , a controversial figure in the blockchain community who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin . Ager-Hanssen stated that the evidence he found suggests Wright manipulated documents to deceive courts about his identity as Satoshi . This led Ager-Hanssen to believe that Wright is not Satoshi and is likely to lose his ongoing legal battles . He expressed regret for not having recognized these issues earlier , referring to Wright as “ # Faketoshi ” in his tweets . Reactions from the Crypto Community Ager-Hanssen ’ s disclosure generated a significant reaction from the cryptocurrency community . Several individuals , including Ray Youssef and Rahul Sood , supported his decision to come forward with the information . Others inquired about his past support for Wright and what changed his perspective . Ager-Hanssen acknowledged that he was misled into believing that Wright was part of the group that created Bitcoin . A Look Back at Algorand Some commentators also touched on Ager-Hanssen ’ s past involvement with Algorand , suggesting that he should have stayed with the project , regarded by some as superior blockchain technology . Ager-Hanssen admitted his mistake and expressed openness to exploring scalable technologies moving forward . The discussions also delved into the broader implications of the former CEO ’ s allegations on the Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) community , which largely rallied around Wright 's claims in the past . Future Endeavors Although the immediate future remains uncertain for Ager-Hanssen , he expressed gratitude for the support received and hinted at his willingness to explore other opportunities in the blockchain space . The narrative underscores a significant event in the ongoing saga surrounding the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and adds another layer to the controversies enveloping nChain and Dr. Craig Wright .

Fact This is a promotional video for ‘ The Royals ’ an American TV series about a fictional British royal family that ran from 2015 to 2018 . Dheeshma PuzhakkalNew Delhi , UPDATED : Sep 13 , 2022 17:28 ISTDid a naked man fall to death while trying to escape from Buckingham Palace ? Following the death of Elizabeth II , The United Kingdom ’ s longest-serving monarch , a video of a naked man climbing down the walls of the London royal residence using a bedsheet has been making the rounds online . However , according to those sharing it , the video is from an old incident where a man fell to death in his attempt to escape from the palace.Did such an incident ever take place though ? AFWA found that the video was part of a TV series and not a real incident.AFWA PROBEA search led us to a Daily Mail report from February 2015 that called this video a hoax . The report said that the Metropolitan Police did not receive any reports of a naked man dangling from a Buckingham Palace window . Likewise , the London Ambulance Service reportedly did not receive any calls to treat a naked man suffering from injuries sustained from a fall from a rope made of bed sheets.As the video went viral , several websites debunked the video . The clip was a promotional video for E ! Entertainment ’ s TV series , “ The Royals ” . The show that ran from 2015 to 2018 was about a fictional modern-day British royal family . In a report , E ! Online also clarified that the video shows a man getting out of Princess Eleanor 's ( a fictional character from the show played by Alexandra Park ) chambers . So , about that viral video of a naked man escaping from Buckingham Palace ... http : //t.co/52779gwT8o — E ! News ( @ enews ) March 3 , 2015D-Throned , a tabloid run by E ! to promote the show “ The Royals ” , also tweeted about the video in March 2015 . Hey @ Variety , ya know that naked guy falling out of a Buckingham Palace window ? We have the real story : http : //t.co/l0j6G42YQQ # TheRoyals — D-Throned News ( @ dthronednews ) March 3 , 2015It is hence clear that the video in question is not from a real incident .

Una pareja de okupas consiguió entrar en su inmueble y aún no ha conseguido recuperar su casa . Se trata de una finca propiedad de Torres en la que el arquitecto tenía construida una casa piloto que enseñaba a sus clientes . Hace dos años , un español y una marroquí saltaron la puerta de entrada y se colaron dentro de la vivienda . Un día , el televisivo arquitecto quiso abrir y se encontró con que lo echaron de su propia casa . Todos las cerraduras estaban rotas y la puerta estaba encadenada . No pudo acceder ni a los jardines . La pareja de okupas había hecho morada por lo que , a nivel legal , Torres no podía hacer nada . La única opción que la legislación española permite al propietario es interponer una demanda y esperar como mínimo un año ( periodo estimado en el que se resuelve la orden de ejecución ) a que llegue la sentencia que los obliga a abandonar el inmueble . Una de las habitaciones del chalet tras la okupación En el informe emitido por el Juzgado de Instrucción Número 4 de Pozuelo de Alarcón , los funcionarios daban fe de que no residía nadie en la propiedad . Según ha transmitido uno de los empleados del despacho de Joaquín Torres , el arquitecto había interpuesto una denuncia por un delito de usurpación ya que `` le aconsejaron sus abogados que así iría más rápido el proceso '' . Si demandaba por okupación `` se iba a alargar mucho les dijeron los juristas '' . De este modo , dos de los trabajadores se dirigieron con el documento en la mano para entrar al inmueble . `` El informe judicial confirmaba que no había nadie dentro y , por lo tanto , podíamos entrar '' , admite el empleado de la agencia de arquitectura a este diario .

Ellos alegaron que era su casa porque llevaban dos años ahí por lo que era su vivienda y no la de Joaquín . Nos llevaron a comisaria y mi compañero durmió en el calabozo '' , confirma el trabajador . Salón del chalet antes de la okupación El reputado arquitecto define estos acontecimientos de `` surrealistas '' e `` incomprensibles '' . Sus trabajadores fueron acusados de `` allanamiento de morada y acoso '' . `` Han dormido en el calabozo por intentar recuperar lo que es mío '' , explicaba con estupor el arquitecto de las celebridades .

( Video : Nutrition and Education International ) ShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveA U.S. drone strike in Kabul that killed 10 civilians , including seven children , was conducted after numerous miscalculations by commanders who wrongly believed an aid worker was hauling explosives in his car , defense officials said Friday , reversing the Pentagon ’ s earlier insistence that the operation prevented an imminent suicide attack on U.S. forces.Sign up for Fact Checker , our weekly review of what 's true , false or in-between in politics.ArrowRightThe Defense Department had previously defended the Aug. 29 operation as a “ righteous strike , ” saying it tracked a white sedan for hours after the vehicle left a suspected Islamic State-Khorasan safe house . In fact , the driver , Zamarai Ahmadi , was a longtime aid worker for a U.S.-based group and was hauling water cans for his family , officials acknowledged. “ We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan , that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced , and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed , ” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement announcing the military ’ s conclusions.Advertisement “ We apologize , ” Austin added , “ and we will endeavor to learn from this horrible mistake. ” Examining a ‘ righteous ’ strike : Expert analysis of deadly U.S. drone strike ’ s aftermath in Kabul suggests no evidence of explosives in targeted vehicleThe chain of missteps ending with the missile strike came days after a suicide attack at the Kabul airport claimed the lives of at least 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members , prompting a sense of urgency among military officials . It also highlights flaws in the Biden administration ’ s strategy for targeting threats that emerge in Afghanistan from long distance , an approach analysts and critics of the president have panned as being vulnerable to inadequate intelligence and overconfidence among commanders reading ordinary behaviors as evidence of malicious intent.The strike followed days of chaos in Kabul as thousands of Afghans tried to flee through the airport . It capped the U.S.-led war with what has come to symbolize Western intervention in Afghanistan , the Middle East and Africa : airstrikes that sometimes kill civilians , followed by initial Pentagon denials that it may have made mistakes far from public view , said Brian Castner , a senior crisis adviser at Amnesty International.AdvertisementThe 10 victims — three adults and seven kids — belonged to a single extended family , a neighbor who witnessed the attack said in the immediate aftermath . He described a gruesome scene of bodies “ covered in blood and shrapnel ” — with some of the dead children still inside the car. “ The U.S. military was only forced to admit to its failure in this strike because of the current global scrutiny on Afghanistan , ” said Castner , a former Air Force bomb technician . “ This is not the end of their obligations . They have to do their own internal investigation to figure out if any crimes were committed. ” Gen . Kenneth “ Frank ” McKenzie , who heads U.S. Central Command and had oversight of the Afghanistan mission as it came to an end last month , said Friday that officials were assessing whether anyone would be held responsible for the errant strike . The U.S. government , McKenzie added , is discussing “ ex gratia ” payments to compensate the victims ’ families.AdvertisementThe commander who oversaw the operation , an American officer who has not been identified publicly , met the standard of “ reasonable certainty ” that a threat was imminent , according to one U.S. official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the military ’ s findings ahead of Friday ’ s announcement.The military ’ s acknowledgment comes after three news organizations , including The Washington Post , published investigations of the incident that each cast doubt on the Pentagon ’ s claims , including whether Ahmadi carried any explosives and whether his actions implied a man who delivered meals to displaced people was secretly moonlighting as a suicidal insurgent . McKenzie acknowledged those reports played a role in determining the military ’ s mistakes.McKenzie said that leading up to the drone strike , intelligence analysts were flooded with dozens of credible reports forecasting attacks on the coalition effort to evacuate Americans and Afghans from the Kabul airport , including links to a white Toyota Corolla — which are among the most common vehicles on the city ’ s roads.AdvertisementOn the morning of Aug. 29 , Ahmadi stopped near a building analysts suspected was an ISIS-K safe house , McKenzie said . He picked up and dropped off people at various places in the city , the general added , and at a few points the vehicle was loaded and unloaded with cargo.Ahmadi arrived home a few minutes before 5 p.m. under the watchful eye of an armed Reaper drone.Share this articleShareThe father of four had a tradition with his kids , his family later said"", ""U.S. drone strike in Kabul mistakenly killed civilians , not terrorists , Pentagon saysIE 11 is not supported .

Kenneth McKenzie , the head of U.S. Central Command , said . `` It was a mistake . `` He said he is `` fully responsible for this strike and the tragic outcome . `` `` I offer my profound condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed , '' McKenzie said.The strike was launched after last month ’ s deadly suicide bombing near Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. military members and scores of Afghan civilians , and was initially said to have prevented another attack.Central Command opened a formal investigation — called a 15-6 — after reports that the drone 's Hellfire missile killed as many as 10 civilians , and had not prevented a terror strike , as U.S. officials initially claimed.The 10 dead were all members of the same extended family , relatives told NBC News , and included the seven children . Some were as young as 2 and 3 . `` They were 10 civilians , '' one member of the family , Emal Ahmadi , said earlier this month . He said his toddler , Malika , was among those killed . `` My daughter ... she was 2 years old , '' he said.The targeted car was driven by Ahmadi 's cousin , Zemari Ahmadi , a technical engineer for a U.S. aid company.An investigation by The New York Times found some of Ahmadi 's actions on the day of the strike may have been misinterpreted by U.S. military surveillance , which was on high alert for a terror attack after the Islamic State Khorasan extremist group claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing outside the Kabul airport that killed 13 U.S. military personnel and more than 110 Afghans.What the military feared were explosives being put into Ahmadi 's car were canisters of water for his family , the Times reported , citing video of his actions earlier in the day.McKenzie said officials had an `` earnest belief '' that there was `` an imminent threat . `` `` This was not a rushed strike . The strike cell deliberately followed and observed this vehicle and its occupants for eight hours , while cross checking what they were seeing with all available intelligence to develop a reasonable certainty of the imminent threat that this vehicle posed to our forces , '' McKenzie said.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement , `` We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan , that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced , and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed . `` `` We apologize , and we will endeavor to learn from this horrible mistake , '' he said.Rep . Adam Schiff , D-Calif , suggested there would be a hearing on what he called `` a mistake with horrific consequences . `` `` We need to know what went wrong in the hours and minutes leading up to the strike to prevent similar tragedies in the future , '' Schiff said in a statement.Gen . Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said after the strike that officials had `` very good intelligence '' on the target , and `` at least one of those people that were killed was an ISIS facilitator . `` `` Were there others killed ? Yes , there were others killed , '' he told reporters Sept. 1 , but “ at this point , we think the procedures were correctly followed , and it was a righteous strike . `` President Joe Biden also initially touted the strike as a success , and proof that the U.S. could carry out `` over the horizon '' strikes from outside Afghanistan . `` We ’ ve shown that capacity just in the last week . We struck ISIS-K remotely , days after they murdered 13 of our service members and dozens of innocent Afghans , '' he said.Dareh GregorianDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.Courtney KubeCourtney Kube is a correspondent covering national security and the military for the NBC News Investigative Unit.Gary Grumbach contributed.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of Service ( Updated JULY 7 , 2023 ) NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo""]","[""As an AI, I can't browse the internet in real time.

The drone strike was aimed at targeting an aid worker falsely suspected of transporting explosives.

The victim, Zamarai Ahmadi, was in fact a long-time aid worker who was transporting water for his family.

Photograph by Bettmann , GettyOne of the earliest known instances in the U.S. of a protester brandishing a raised fist occurred in 1913 , when “ Big Bill ” Haywood spoke to strikers during the Paterson silk strike in New Jersey . Haywood , a founding member of the union Industrial Workers of the World , preached working-class solidarity across all races and trades. “ Every finger by itself has no force , ” he said , lifting his sizable hand to the crowd . “ Now look , ” he said , closing his fingers into a fist . “ See that , that ’ s the IWW. ” Although that unified position gave the IWW the strength to achieve many of its goals for workers around the world , the workers ’ movement faced violent opposition . By the 1920s , street battles were common between workers and the hired guns of employers—and between followers of different political ideologies . In 1926 , one of the combatants , a German group called the Red Front Fighters ( RFB ) , patented the clenched fist as part of their uniform and salute.To Ernst Thälmann , leader of the RFB , the fist was a pledge to “ protect the friend and fight off the enemy. ” But the RFB , founded to guard Communist Party meetings from far-right attacks , battled as much against the Iron Front , the Social Democrats ’ street-fighting arm , as it did fascists of the rising Nazi party . In 1932 , the RFB rebranded as Antifaschistische Aktion—better known by the contraction antifa . The Nazis took power a year later ; Thälmann and hundreds of his comrades died in concentration camps.Members of the anti-Nazi Red Front Fighters give the clenched fist salute in 1928 .

In 1936 , anti-fascists resisted when the British Union of Fascists attempted to march through Jewish neighborhoods in London . As many as 100,000 dockworkers , children , workers , and members of the Jewish community stood shoulder to shoulder with fists in the air and turned the fascists back.The events that brought the raised fist back to the United States as a symbol of the fight against racial oppression began earlier that year in Spain .

The raised fist was notably used in Europe during the fight against fascism, with the Red Front Fighters (RFB) using it as part of their uniform and salute. The symbol was later adopted by the anti-fascist Popular Front coalition, including exiled Germans, and used to protest signs of fascism in democratic nations.

On April 23 , 2020 , social media users encountered numerous comments that claimed U.S. President Donald Trump had suggested injecting disinfectants as a cure for COVID-19 during a White House press briefing . As many of these comments included jokes instead of a link to Trump 's alleged remarks , some people were left wondering what Trump actually said about disinfectants , injections , and COVID-19 . The comment in question came shortly after a presentation by William N. Bryan , the acting undersecretary for science and technology at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , about how heat and humidity could impact the spread of COVID-19 during the summer months . Bryan mentioned a recent , non-peer-reviewed study that showed how disinfectants and sunlight could kill the coronavirus on non-porous surfaces such as counters or door handles . Bryan 's presentation focused on how light and disinfectants affected the coronavirus on surfaces . But when Trump took the podium , he started talking about what would happen if light and disinfectants were `` brought inside the body '' to fight the virus . Here 's the official White House transcript of Trump 's remarks ( emphasis added ) : THE PRESIDENT : Thank you very much . So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of , if you 're totally into that world , which I find to be very interesting . So , supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it 's ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that has n't been checked , but you 're going to test it . And then I said , supposing you brought the light inside the body , which you can do either through the skin or in some other way , and I think you said you 're going to test that too . It sounds interesting . ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN : We 'll get to the right folks who could . THE PRESIDENT : Right . And then I see the disinfectant , where it knocks it out in a minute . One minute . And is there a way we can do something like that , by injection inside or almost a cleaning . Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs . So it would be interesting to check that . So , that , you 're going to have to use medical doctors with . But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me . So we 'll see . But the whole concept of the light , the way it kills it in one minute , that 's — that 's pretty powerful . Trump made this comment following a presentation on how sunlight and disinfectant affect the coronavirus . This presentation prompted Trump to discuss a question he said `` probably some of you are thinking of '' concerning what would happen if you `` brought the light inside the body . '' As Trump continued , he also offered his thoughts on how disinfectants could be brought inside the body `` by injection . '' While Trump noted that this method would have to be checked by doctors , he said it sounded interesting to him . The remarks spurred widespread condemnation from health officials , who issued statements urging people not to inject or ingest cleaning products . Dr. Vin Gupta , a pulmonologist and global health policy expert and NBC News contributor , said : `` This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible , and it 's dangerous . It 's a common method that people utilize when they want to kill themselves .

Nur Ibrahim Published Jun 27 , 2023 Image Via National Photo Company Collection/Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons In June 2023 , a five-person submersible attempting to explore the Titanic shipwreck imploded , killing everyone on board . As news of their deaths spread , old interview clips of Stockton Rush , the CEO of OceanGate , the company behind the submersible , went viral . In the videos , while describing his process for creating a submersible with the goal of reaching the Titanic ruins , Rush repeated a quote that he attributed to U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur : `` You 're remembered for the rules you break . '' For instance , in one clip shared on TikTok , Rush was recorded saying : `` I 'd like to be remembered as an innovator . I think it was General [ Douglas ] MacArthur who said , 'You 're remembered for the rules you break . ' And I 've broken some rules to make this . I think I 've broken them with logic and good engineering behind me . '' Rush 's above quote came from a 2021 interview with YouTuber Alan Estrada ( around the 24-minute mark ) : But was the source of the quote about rule breaking really MacArthur — the U.S. general who commanded the Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II and served as the Allied commander of the postwar occupation of Japan ? Various quotes with the same sentiment have been attributed to him across the internet , in newspapers , and in books . While it was possible that he said or wrote the remark — some secondhand sources claimed that its premise about rule-breaking , at least , originated with him — there appeared to be no evidence to independently verify that that was the case . We could not find a document authored by MacArthur with the quote , or an audio recording of him saying it , to prove without a doubt that he said or wrote it . MacArthur , who also commanded United Nations forces during the Korean war , had a widely debated legacy , achieving many awards and being highly lauded for his time leading World War II troops . But , in recent times , a number of historians have described him as `` overrated '' and `` among America 's worst generals . '' His career unceremoniously ended in 1951 when President Harry Truman fired him for ignoring direct orders and thwarting Truman 's attempt to negotiate a ceasefire during the Korean War . As for the quote allegedly attributed to him , we found a decades-old version of the statement , verbatim , in a 1996 issue of the Press of Atlantic City newspaper . In that edition 's `` Thought of the Day '' section , MacArthur was quoted as saying , `` You are remembered for the rules you break . '' Also citing MacArthur , a 2007 blog post by a law firm claimed the quote was this : `` Rules are mostly made to be broken and are too often for the lazy to hide behind . '' We were only able to find secondhand sources that quoted MacArthur making such a statement . They were stories by his fellow soldiers about their interactions with MacArthur . We reached out to the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk , Virginia , an organization that hosts archival material about the general , and asked if researchers there had encountered the quote repeated by the OceanGate CEO or variations it . James Zobel , the memorial 's archivist , said the quote came from the diaries of Major Gen. George Leach , which he wrote during World War I when MacArthur was commander of the 84th Brigade . According to Zobel 's interpretation of the diaries and historical circumstances surrounding them ( emphasis , ours ) : Just before the battle of San Mihiel , Leach came to MacArthur and told him that the Corps orders for artillery was madness . MacArthur as commander of the 84th Brigade sat down with Leach and they created an artillery plan that would work for the next day 's offensive by the Rainbow . Leach and MacArthur did not tell higher headquarters and Leach remembered MacArthur saying , 'Sometimes it is the order one disobeys that makes them famous . ' Leach served with MacArthur during World War I . First , MacArthur was in charge of the Rainbow Division , and , by the end of the war , he was a brigadier general . According to the Minnesota Military Museum , MacArthur regarded Leach as `` the finest artillery officer in the Army . '' We found a different version of the alleged quote in the 1962 book `` MacArthur Close‑Up '' by William Addleman Ganoe . Ganoe , according to his own account and a 1962 review of the book , was MacArthur 's adjutant , or administrative assistant , while MacArthur was a superintendent at West Point Military Academy . The book covered a two-year period , and Ganoe claimed to have had its contents corroborated by Major Gen. Robert M. Danford who wrote a foreword to the book .

However, there was no evidence found to independently verify MacArthur as the originator of this quote. The closest version was found in the diaries of Major Gen. George Leach.

The video was actually of Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman at the 2023 Stewart Manor Parade, a Fourth of July event where it's a tradition for participants to be hit with water balloons. The girl who threw the balloon was identified as 10-year-old Alexa Cardona. Blakeman shared the video on his Facebook page, assuring that the water balloons were part of the parade's fun.

Status code: 429'],"['The statement ""Failed to retrieve tweet. Status code: 429"" indicates an issue or error in accessing a specific tweet, which is a message posted on the social media platform Twitter. The issue lies in the status code 429, which error message signifies that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (""rate limiting"").\n\nThe status code 429 is part of HTTP response status codes within the 4xx category, which are classified as client error responses. These responses are used when the client looks like it has erred, such as by asking for a resource that does not exist or making too many requests. Essentially, this specific status code is Twitter\'s way of implementing control over the number of requests sent to its server to prevent any potential abuse or overload.\n\nThis particular issue can occur for several reasons. It could be that the user has been doing too many activities, such as tweeting, retweeting, liking, or following people at an unusually rapid rate. It could also be due to an overly active API call from a third-party application synced with the user\'s Twitter account. Twitter sets a limit on these activities to avoid any form of spamming or DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack.\n\nTo resolve this, the user would have to wait until Twitter’s server resets the count. During this time period, it\'s recommended not to send any more requests to prevent further delays. The time it takes for the server to reset the count can vary, depending on the specific user’s rate limit window.']"

EDT PRESIDENT BIDEN : Okay . We — I was just thanking the — anyway , I started off without you , and I sold a lot of state secrets and a lot of very important things that we shared . ( Laughter . ) Now , all kidding aside — look , we ’ re teaming up to design and develop new technologies that are going to transform the lives of our people around the world . And together , we ’ re lifting the private and public partners to make this possible , including launching a new program between India and America — American astronauts , Indian astronauts , and entrepreneurs , scientists , students . Simply put , our countries are ta- — taking innovation and cooperation to a new level in our relationship , and thanks in large part to the folks around this table . So my message today is really simple : We ’ ve got to keep it up , and we have to make sure we aim even higher . We ’ re — we ’ re going to see more technol- — technological change — you ’ ve heard me say this a number of times — in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 years — and maybe in the next few years — the last 50 years . And we need your help — and I ’ m talking to the CEOs around this table , Indian and American . We need your help to seize the moment , to help manage the risk to our societies , our economies , and to our nations ’ national security . We need your help to build guardrails around emerging technologies so that they ’ re trustworthy , they ’ re secure , and uphold our shared value and human rights . We need you to help us expand our partnership into new fields , in biotechnology as well as quantum . You know , as you all know well , innovation and collaboration are rarely without obstacles . And so , you raise our ambitions , and I want you to let us know what stands in the way of our ambitions as well . Be straight with us . The speed bumps are — are impeding technological partnership — what they are , when they occur . So the Prime Minister and I can commit to building around them , over them , and through them . Because it matters — our cooperation matters — not just to our own people but , I quite frankly think , to the whole world . Because our partnership is about more than the next breakthrough or the next deal and — as big as they may be . It ’ s about taking climate change — it ’ s about tackling it . It ’ s about exploring the universe . It ’ s about lifting people out of poverty ; curing cancer and other serious diseases ; preventing pandemics ; and giving our citizens — all our citizens real opportunity . And about — it ’ s about forging a more free , secure , and more prosperous future for our children , supporting the dynamism and diversity of our democracies and democracies everywhere . We ’ re sticking up for our values and the vision of our — vision of the world . And so , our partnership between India and the United States will go a long way , in my view , to define what the 21st century looks like . And our technology and technological cooperation will be a big part of defining our partnership — our partnership . So I look forward to continuing working with all of you and — on our voyage']","[""President Biden and Prime Minister Modi of India met with senior officials and CEOs of technology companies to discuss cooperation and innovation in new technologies.

President Joe Biden backed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's claim that Israeli forces did ... [ + ] not launch an airstrike at a Gaza City hospital.AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Biden told reporters on Wednesday that Defense Department data gave him confidence the explosion was not the result of an Israeli airstrike , and told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a visit to Israel that the strike appeared to have been launched by “ the other team , not you. ” Biden said in a press conference the explosion appeared to be the result of an “ errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza , ” while White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also claimed Israel was not responsible for the strike , citing “ analysis of overhead imagery , intercepts and open source information. ” In a statement , the Israel Defense Forces claimed the hospital was hit in a “ failed shooting ” by Gaza-based militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad , during an “ enemy rocket barrage ” aimed at Israel that passed over the hospital at the time the facility was struck . Netanyahu also claimed the airstrike was the result of a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad , citing “ intelligence from multiple sources. ” The Palestinian Health Ministry , meanwhile , alleges the hospital was hit by an Israeli airstrike , part of a dayslong bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip . Multiple outlets , citing the Health Ministry , put the number of casualties from the strike at 500—hospitals have been functioning as a refugee camp for displaced Palestinians for the past week . Contra Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas—a Hamas rival who runs the Palestinian Authority , which controls the West Bank but not the Gaza Strip—canceled a planned trip with Biden in Jordan after the hospital explosion , the Associated Press reported . Biden was scheduled to meet with Abbas as part of a Middle East trip that also includes a visit to Israel . Crucial Quote “ Immediately upon hearing this news , I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan , and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened , ” Biden said in a statement , adding the U.S. “ stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict. ” Key Background The hospital explosion came amid an Israeli counter-offensive in the 10 days since Hamas launched an assault on Israel , killing more than 1,400 Israeli citizens and taking civilian hostages . Israel ’ s military last week gave more than one million residents of densely populated Gaza City 24 hours to evacuate to the Gaza Strip ’ s southern border , following Netanyahu ’ s declaration of war against Hamas . Netanyahu says Israel ’ s mission in the war is to “ destroy ” the militant group that rules Gaza—the United Nations , however , cautioned such a swift evacuation would be “ impossible ” without “ devastating humanitarian consequences. ” Tangent The UN ’ s Palestinian refugee agency also warned on Tuesday that fuel reserves at Gaza hospitals are running""]","['President Joe Biden has backed Israel\'s claim that it was not responsible for a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza, which killed hundreds of people.

It is an HTTP response that is sent when a user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (""rate limiting"") as defined by the service they\'re accessing.\n\nIn the context of Twitter, the company imposes certain limits on how many requests a user or an application can send to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage for all users. These limits can be set on various time scales (e.g., per 15-minute window, per 24-hour period) and different types of requests may have different limits. When a user exceeds these limits, Twitter\'s servers respond with a 429 status code to indicate that no more requests can be accepted from that user for a certain time period.\n\nIn practical terms, this means the user or application that received this error message has made too many requests to retrieve tweets within Twitter\'s rate limits and must wait before attempting to retrieve more tweets. The user may need to optimize their request patterns to stay within the allowed limits, and/or consider using other Twitter API features which are designed for large-scale data retrieval.\n\nThis error has implications for developers of Twitter-oriented applications, as these rate limits need to be taken into account in the app design and operation to prevent behavior that could trigger a 429 status code and a suspension of the service.

Alegam que a Jovem Pan “ disseminou reiteradamente conteúdos que desacreditaram , sem provas , o processo eleitoral de 2022 ” . Além disso , “ atacaram autoridades e instituições da República , incitaram a desobediência a leis e decisões judiciais ” . Da mesma forma , “ defenderam a intervenção das Forças Armadas sobre os Poderes civis constituídos e incentivaram a população a subverter a ordem política e social ” . Greg News mostrou que Jovem Pan é uma ameaça à liberdade de imprensa e à Democracia Nesse sentido , os procuradores afirmam que a emissora contribuiu para que “ enorme número de pessoas ” duvidasse da idoneidade do processo eleitoral e tomasse “ ações diretas ” contra o resultado das urnas . Citam , por exemplo , os bloqueios nas rodovias após o resultado do segundo turno , bem como a tentativa de golpe em 8 de janeiro , quando bolsonaristas invadiram e depredaram as sedes dos três poderes . Linha editorial golpistaO MPF conduziu uma análise detalhada do conteúdo transmitido pela Jovem Pan entre janeiro de 2022 e janeiro de 2023 . A investigação teve foco em programas específicos , como “ Os Pingos nos Is “ , “ 3 em 1 “ , “ Morning Show ” e “ Linha de Frente “ . Assim , o levantamento revelou uma série de discursos que ultrapassaram os limites da liberdade de expressão e configuraram manifestações ilícitas . Mais de 20 comentaristas foram identificados como defensores das mesmas teses , alinhadas à linha editorial da emissora . Desde os primeiros meses de 2022 , os comentaristas da Jovem Pan afirmavam repetidamente que as urnas eletrônicas não eram seguras . Do mesmo modo , sustentavam a ideia de impossibilidade de auditagem dos aparelhos , além de alegar um conluio entre autoridades para manipular os resultados das eleições . Essas afirmações eram infundadas , pois as urnas eletrônicas são submetidas a testes e auditorias que nunca indicaram brechas para fraudes . Os comentaristas também direcionaram ataques ao Supremo Tribunal Federal ( STF ) e ao Tribunal Superior Eleitoral ( TSE ) , inclusive contra seus ministros . Chegaram a utilizar inclusive termos como “ entrave ” e “ câncer ” para caracterizar as cortes . Eles defendiam frequentemente que o Senado abrisse processo de impeachment contra os membros do STF , especialmente Alexandre de Moraes . Além disso , incitaram a desobediência às ordens judiciais e propuseram uma intervenção militar para “ restabelecer a ordem ” , elogiando a ditadura militar e defendendo atos violentos . A ação do MPF destaca que as manifestações da emissora procuravam legitimar atos de grupos radicalizados , que pediam intervenção militar . Nesse sentido , propunham uma “ guerra civil ” como alternativa ao suposto impasse institucional . Em 8 de janeiro , a cobertura da Jovem Pan tratou com normalidade a chegada dos bolsonaristas e elogiou o ato até que os ataques começaram . A partir daí , o discurso dos comentaristas se tornou mais moderado , mas ainda tentando legitimar as ações golpistas . Inconstitucional e ilegalAssim , para o MPF , a Jovem Pan praticou atos ilegais e abusou de seu serviço público . A ação se baseia na Constituição Federal e em legislação específica que estabelecem limites para o conteúdo veiculado pela radiodifusão , visando preservar os interesses da coletividade . Assim , as normas legais estabelecem que as empresas de radiodifusão devem dar preferência a finalidades educativas , artísticas , culturais e informativas , respeitando os valores éticos e sociais da pessoa e os direitos fundamentais dos cidadãos . O MPF alega que a Jovem Pan cometeu diversas condutas abusivas , como incentivar a desobediência , veicular notícias falsas que colocam em perigo a ordem pública , econômica e social , e incitar a rebeldia ou indisciplina nas Forças Armadas .

Bobbie JohnsonWed 15 Jul 2009 12.30 EDTThis article is the subject of a legal complaint from Evony LLC.After publication of this article , a representative of Evony LLC contacted us . He said neither the company nor its owners were associated with internet fraud or scams . He said Evony denied any suggestion that it had `` ripped off '' predecessor games and said a considerable amount had been invested in research and development to produce a unique game . Evony said it did not charge players for sending a message to other players and was not responsible for nor did it encourage the use of spam messages referring to Evony.Quite possibly . If you 've been anywhere near the internet in recent weeks , you may well have noticed the vast number of promotions for a game called Evony – campaigns on websites featuring buxom fantasy queens ; countless Google ads and ( more disturbingly ) millions of spam comments left on blogs.On the surface , Evony is a pretty standard online strategy game – a simulation in which players take the role of a medieval noble who must build up an empire . But the way the game has been marketed has created a bit of a stir : the games marketer Bruce Everiss has charted the volume of spam being sent by its creators , while Jeff Atwood , a US programmer and blogger , has documented the ads ' increasingly racy nature – from a simple medieval warrior promising the game would be `` free forever '' , through a string of increasingly racy images ... until , finally , it was simply advertising itself by showing a pair of breasts . `` Thanks for showing us what it means to take advertising on the internet to the absolute rock bottom ... then dig a sub-basement under that , and keep on digging until you reach the white-hot molten core of the Earth , '' he wrote last week.It 's not just the advertising that has got the internet up in arms , however – the game itself has drawn criticism from many quarters . Evony takes its inspiration from Civilization , the classic Sid Meier series . In fact , its slavish devotion stretches not only to its original name – it was known as Civony until recently – but also to the details of the game itself ; a format so familiar that more than a few gamers to question whether Evony has simply ripped off its predecessors.And as if bad advertising and tenuous intellectual property were not enough , the game is also under fire for its business model – a system that seems intent on getting players to spend as much money as possible . Players are encouraged to buy in-game extras to speed their progress – but the confusing way the game prices its add-ons means that many users may not realise that a simple action , such as sending a message to another player , can cost 15p a time.All of this has swirled into a storm of criticism around Evony – except on the game 's own web forums , where mentions of its most controversial practices are deleted by moderators . So if Evony is the world 's most despised game , who is behind it ? It turns out that the site 's backers are equally unpopular . Evony is the product of Universal Multiplayer Game Entertainment ( UMGE ) , a developer linked to a Chinese gold-farming operation called WoWMine . That site has also come in for regular criticism , but the real kicker comes with the news that the company 's owners are being sued by Microsoft over allegations of click fraud.Perhaps Evony is n't the most hated game on the internet : but it certainly runs close.Explore more on these topicsSpamNewly asked questionsInternetGamesAdvertisingMMORPGStrategy gamesReuse this contentComments ( … ) Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentUS PoliticsUkraineSoccerBusinessTechScienceNewslettersWellnessNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis , direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies .

Ads began appearing on the internet for a game called Civony , later renamed Evony . They started innocently enough – `` Free Forever '' one banner ad claimed while an image of a knight wielding a sword took up half the ad . Then a woman appeared . `` Start your journey now , my Lord ! '' this ad said , an attractive woman dressed as a fairy standing to the side . Over the next few months , the ads became progressively more risqué , first featuring CGI women displaying ample bosom , proceeding to real models undressing . Eventually the medieval theme of the ads was abandoned and replaced with models in lingerie.AdvertisementThe internet was buzzing with criticism over Evony 's advertising . Many people were upset that such sexualised images were being used to market a game , with claims being made that it was a poor Civilization clone that was n't worth anyone 's time . It was a controversial ad campaign that attracted criticism from both the game development and game playing community alike . It was also a successful one.AdvertisementDo You Come With The Car ? `` Initially , the goal was to get the game in front of as many people as possible , '' says Darold Higa , a lead producer on Evony who joined the company in 2010.Advertisement '' The ads were very successful in bringing people to the website . I understand there was a lot of criticism about them , but I remember even before joining the company I looked at the criticism and thought it was a bit hypocritical because there are a lot of other games that do that . `` Higa is n't far off the mark . Numerous games use sex to sell , with female characters often being over-sexualised and leaving little to the imagination . There could be an argument for the fact that none of the models in the Evony ads actually have anything to do with the game itself , but he believes the team behind Evony were simply doing what was best for the game.Advertisement '' The whole idea with a browser-based free-to-play game like Evony is to put it in front of a large an audience as possible and say ‘ Here you go , try it for yourself ' . That was the end message : ‘ Look at this ' . `` And look at it they most certainly did . After the beta went live two years ago , Evony – a free-to-play a massively multiplayer real-time strategy ( MMORTS ) set in medieval times - currently has 27 million registered users , although the figures on active users were not made available to us . Evony currently runs on 250 servers that are active 24/7 and the game has been so successful that the team behind it launched the game 's second age , Age II , an upgrade on the first , last year . At beta the company had a handful of permanent staff with contractors . Now the company employs more than 170 people in publishing , marketing , programming , level design , and production , and all these roles are being supported by the one game , Evony.AdvertisementThe Game Behind The AdsSo what is Evony ? In 2009 , having read the criticism and dismissive comments , I wanted to see the game for myself . Clicking through one of the ads , I arrived at Evony 's homepage where a CGI woman , eyes closed , cleavage on display , instructed me to sign up . I did . I then clicked to `` Play Now '' . I followed the in-game tutorial and read the live chat-feed of others who were playing on my server . They were planning some sort of attack on a colony ; they were discussing resource management.AdvertisementI began clicking away at this game , which reminded me of other city-building games I 'd played in the past . It was n't quite a Civilization clone , but I could n't put my finger on what it was , either . The game offered micro-transactions ; you could play the entire game for free , but small payments would buy you perks and bonuses , similar to other free-to-play MMOs.The game had a distinct lack of females , let alone lingerie-clad ladies beckoning me to go and `` play with '' them . `` This game has no hot chicks at all ! '' I joked at the time , looking at an interface that resembled a client-based city-building game.AdvertisementSo I ask Higa this : if Evony is a fully-functional and supported game that clearly has enough going for it to attract and engage players , why did they go with boobs to begin with ? `` Being perfectly honest , it"", 'Ébano - O Regresso do Rei não é o jogo que você imagina Home Plataformas PlayStation Xbox Nintendo PC Stadia Mobile Retrô RPG / Tabuleiro The Last of Us já venceu 8 Emmys 07.01.2024 , ÀS 18H05 Street Fighter 6 revela Akuma 03.01.2024 , ÀS 11H24 News Reviews Artigos Listas Entrevistas Extras Web Stories Lançamentos Especiais Vídeos The Last of Us já venceu 8 Emmys 07.01.2024 , ÀS 18H05 Street Fighter 6 revela Akuma 03.01.2024 , ÀS 11H24 Big Festival Tech Android Apple Windows Gadgets Hardware Social Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 é um sonho 12.05.2023 , ÀS 11H30 Fusão entre Activision e Microsoft é barrada 26.04.2023 , ÀS 09H20 Esports Sobre Menu principal PlayStation Xbox Nintendo PC Stadia Mobile Retrô RPG / Tabuleiro Menu principal Web Stories Lançamentos Especiais Vídeos Menu principal Tudo Android Apple Windows Gadgets Hardware Social Menu principal Quem Somos Anuncie Destaques : INCREVA-SE NA NOVA NEWSLETTER / APPLETV+ : CLIQUE AQUI E EXPERIMENTE GRÁTIS POR 7 DIAS PESQUISE POR TERMOS , PLATAFORMAS OU JOGOS BUSCAR Mobile Apple Android Ébano - O Regresso do Rei não é o jogo que você imagina Propagandas do título são comuns no Android e no iOS Por Diego Lima 09.05.2022 , ÀS 13H13 2 min de leitura Qualquer pessoa com o costume de jogar no celular , seja em dispositivos Android ou iOS , pode ter sido impactada com uma propaganda do jogo Ébano - O Regresso do Rei .

This is due to several reasons including its aggressive marketing methods, unoriginal gameplay, and questionable business model. The game's marketing strategy, which includes using sexually suggestive material, has been heavily linked to a considerable amount of internet spam. The gameplay has been criticised as being overly derivative of the Civilization series, with some describing it as a direct 'rip-off'. Its business model has drawn criticism as many players are encouraged to buy in-game extras without realizing the costs. Criticisms of the game seem to be systematically deleted from its web forums. The game's developer, Universal Multiplayer Game Entertainment (UMGE), is also quite unpopular and is allegedly involved in a Chinese gold-farming operation known as WoWMine. Furthermore, the owners of UMGE are currently being sued by Microsoft over allegations of click fraud.\n"", ""Evony is a free-to-play massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game (MMORTS) that gained notoriety for its provocative and misleading advertising campaign.

Despite drawing widespread criticism, Evony’s Lead Producer, Darold Higa, defended the successful campaign. He also highlighted other games' use of over-sexualised female characters. Encouraging users to try the game, Evony saw significant growth, having 27 million registered users, running on 250 servers, and even launching a second-age upgrade of the game.

This statement suggests that there is a problem retrieving a specific Twitter post or series of posts. The error might not necessarily be from the tweet itself, but could be a connection or server issue.\n\nThe status code ""429"" is significant. In the context of HTTP status codes, code 429 stands for ""Too Many Requests"". This is issued by the server when a user, or the application, has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. Twitter, like many other online platforms, has a rate limiting policy to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.\n\nRate limiting is a technique for limiting network traffic. It sets a limit on how many requests a client can make to the server in a specific timeframe. This technique is used to control the data processing and managing the server\'s resources. When the threshold for the permitted number of requests is exceeded, the server responds with the HTTP status code 429 - Too Many Requests.\n\nIn this case, the user or the application might be trying to fetch too many tweets in a short period, thereby breaching Twitter’s rate limiting policy. Consequently, Twitter’s server has temporarily blocked further requests. The best way to resolve this issue would be to slow down the request rate or distribute the requests more evenly over time to avoid hitting the rate limit.']"

Despite the name recognition he has earned over the years , a few questions remain about this prominent YouTuber and philanthropist . Namely , people really want to know his height . Maybe it ’ s due to the numerous videos and pictures floating around the web in which MrBeast — whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson — can be seen towering over his companions . MrBeast ’ s height Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic A few photos indicate that the veteran YouTuber stands above 6 feet , sparking an insatiable desire from fans to discover his true height . Consensus seems to agree that Donaldson stands at approximately 6 ft 3 in tall . That places him several inches , at least , above many of his fellow YouTubers , and even some larger-than-life stars , like Chris Evans . Photos on Instagram reveal MrBeast truly does tower over others at his high stature . He ’ s tall enough to touch a stop sign with ease , stands high over cars , and is regularly front-and-center in group photos due to the extra inches he has on his colleagues .

By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter , New YorkGetty ImagesShe was `` the world 's youngest self-made female billionaire '' , trumpeted Forbes magazine . The `` next Steve Jobs '' , said Inc , another business magazine that put her on the cover.In 2014 , Elizabeth Holmes , then 30 years old , was on top of the world . A Stanford University drop-out , she had founded a company valued at $ 9bn ( £6.5bn ) for supposedly bringing about a revolution in diagnosing disease . With a few drops of blood , Theranos promised that its Edison test could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes quickly without the hassle of needles . Bigwigs from Henry Kissinger to general James Mattis sat on the board.But by 2015 , the seams were coming apart , and within a year , Holmes was exposed as a fake . The technology she touted did n't work at all , and by 2018 the company she founded had collapsed . In January , she was convicted by a jury in California on four counts of fraud , each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.The jury found her not guilty on four other charges and failed to reach a verdict on three more . Holmes , who had pleaded not guilty to all charges , sought a new trial but those requests were denied . She was sentenced on Friday to 11 years and three months in prison . Drew AngererMedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch lost £120m he had invested in TheranosDuring the trial Holmes accused her ex-boyfriend and business partner , Ramesh `` Sunny '' Balwani , of emotional and sexual abuse at the time of the alleged crimes , impairing her mental state.Balwani , 56 , who faced the same fraud charges , was convicted in July and is due to be sentenced next month . He had called the claims `` outrageous '' . High pressure beginningsDespite being the subject of a book , HBO documentary , TV series and an upcoming film , it is still unclear why Holmes took such a gamble on technology she knew did n't work.She was raised in a comfortably well-off family in Washington DC , and was a polite but withdrawn child , according to people who knew her.Inventor and businessman Richard Fuisz , 81 , speculated there must have been immense pressure on Holmes to succeed . His family lived next door to the Holmes family for years , but they fell out when Theranos sued him over a patent dispute in 2011 ( it was later settled ) . Theranos founder hit with criminal chargesWhen to fire the boss : A tale of three sackingsHolmes 's parents spent much of their careers as bureaucrats on Capitol Hill , but `` they were very interested in status '' and `` lived for connections '' , he told the BBC . Her father 's great-great-grandfather founded Fleischmann 's Yeast , which changed America 's bread industry , and the family was very conscious about its lineage , he said . At age nine , the young Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father declaring that what she `` really want [ ed ] out of life is to discover something new , something that mankind did n't know was possible to do '' .When she got to Stanford University in 2002 to study chemical engineering , she came up with an idea for a patch that could scan the wearer for infections and release antibiotics as needed.Getty ImagesDr Phyllis Gardner told Holmes her idea would not workAt 18 , she already displayed an intransigence that would apparently continue and drive the company she would found the following year . Phyllis Gardner , an expert in clinical pharmacology at Stanford , recalled discussing Holmes 's skin-patch idea and telling her it `` would n't work '' . `` She just stared through me , '' Dr Gardner told the BBC . `` And she just seemed absolutely confident of her own brilliance . She was n't interested in my expertise and it was upsetting . `` Meteoric riseMonths later Holmes dropped out of Stanford aged 19 and launched Theranos , this time coming up with an apparently revolutionary way of testing blood from a simple finger prick . Powerful people were enthralled and invested without seeing audited financial accounts . US Treasury Secretary George Schultz , media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and America 's richest family , the Waltons , were among her backers . The support lent her credibility , as did her demeanour . `` I knew she 'd had this brilliant idea and that she had managed to convince all these investors and scientists , '' said Dr Jeffrey Flier , the former dean of Harvard Medical School , who met her for lunch in 2015 . `` She was self-assured , but when I asked her several questions about her technology she did n't look like she understood , '' added Dr Flier , who never formally assessed her technology . `` It seemed a bit odd , but I did n't come away thinking it was a fraud . `` Getty ImagesOn stage with former US President Bill Clinton in 2015 . At the time Ms Holmes was said to be the world 's youngest self-made female billionaireDr Flier ended up inviting her to join the medical school 's Board of Fellows , which he regrets , although she was removed when the""]","['Elizabeth Holmes was the founder of Theranos, a health technology company that claimed to have developed a revolutionary blood testing method.

For starters , it would be able to provide sufficient aquatic food for our growing population in a sustainable way . It would contribute to improving the rights and incomes of communities that are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture and help to achieve equitable livelihoods . The perfect aquatic food system would also be resilient to human and environmental shocks , including climate change . Achieving this vision is possible , and necessary . Let ’ s see why we need to transform our aquatic food systems and how we can make it happen . Firstly , why do we need a blue transformation ? Whether they come from inland sources like rivers and lakes or the ocean , fish and other aquatic animals play a crucial role in global food security and nutrition . Yet , the production and distribution of aquatic foods faces many challenges . Strategies to deliver healthy , sustainable and equitable food systems need to adequately deal with overfishing and other unsustainable practices , unequal access to resources and markets , and the environmental impacts of aquatic food production . Aquatic food production is forecast to increase by a further 15 % by 2030 . Such growth is necessary to provide a growing population with healthy and nutritious foods . It also needs to be environmental , social and economically sustainable , while minimizing ecosystem impacts , ensuring social equality and responding to the consequences of climate change . To achieve this , we require a transformation of our aquatic food systems . ©FAO/Luis Tato To move forward , we need to know where we stand Before we can successfully transform our aquatic food systems , we need to know the current state of global fisheries and aquaculture . So , at a glance , how do things currently look ? Total fisheries and aquaculture production reached an all-time record of 214 million tonnes in 2020 , comprising : 178 million tonnes of aquatic animals 36 million tonnes ( wet weight ) of algae The production of aquatic animals represents a growth of 0.2 percent compared with 2019 and a drop of 0.6 percent compared with the previous record production of 2018 . This was due to a 4.4 percent decline in capture fisheries in 2019 compared with 2018 , and a further 2 percent decrease in 2020 , caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors . Nevertheless , capture fisheries remains globally stable and the 2020 total is close to the 1995-2020 average annual production . Despite the decline in capture fisheries , aquaculture continued to demonstrate growth in the last two years , albeit at a slower yearly rate . As a result , the production of aquatic animals directly used for human consumption reached 157 million tonnes in 2020 , the second highest on record . World capture fisheries and aquaculture production Capture fisheries - inland waters Capture fisheries - marine waters Aquaculture - inland waters Aquaculture - marine waters NOTE : Excludes aquatic mammals , crocodiles , alligators and caimans , seaweeds and other algae.SOURCE : FAO . Capture fisheries production In 2020 , global capture fisheries production was 90.3 million tonnes – a fall of 4.0 percent compared with the average over the previous three years . The decrease is most likely due to the disruption in fishing operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic , the ongoing reduction in China ’ s catches ( 10 percent lower in 2020 compared with the average of the previous three years ) , and a reduction in naturally-fluctuating anchoveta catches .

At the regional level , the annual output of African aquaculture ( excluding algae ) contracted slightly - down 1.2 percent in 2020 compared with 2019 . This was mainly due to the drop in production in Egypt , Africa ’ s major producer . In Nigeria , sub-Saharan Africa ’ s largest producer , the declining trend in output evident since 2016 decreased a further 9.6 percent in 2020 .

The ideal aquatic food system would sustainably provide sufficient food for the growing population, improve the livelihoods of communities dependent on fisheries/aquaculture, and have resilience against environmental and human shocks such as climate change. The production and distribution of aquatic foods face challenges such as unsustainable practices, unequal access to resources, and environmental impacts. Despite a 0.6% drop compared to 2018 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, total fisheries and aquaculture production reached a record 214 million tonnes in 2020. Aquaculture showed growth despite a decline in capture fisheries. Knowledge of the current state of global fisheries and aquaculture is essential for successful transformation. The article concludes with a call for transformation to sustainable, holistic aquatic food systems.\n', 'The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) website provides information about the impacts of livestock systems on the environment and outlines their efforts to transform and make these systems more sustainable, productive, and resilient. Livestock farming contributes to climate change, land degradation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Therefore, the FAO is working to reduce its environmental impacts while also promoting food security, nutrition, poverty alleviation, and economic growth. It provides policy advice, institutional capacity building, monitoring of progress, and facilitates partnerships across governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as the private sector and academia. They also develop tools and guidelines, run projects, and initiate dialogues to promote sustainable livestock farming. One key initiative is the Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance (LEAP) Partnership, which assesses the environmental impacts of feed and livestock production.']"

In technical terms, Status Code 429 directly refers to ""Too Many Requests"".\n\nTwitter has a set limit on how many times an application or a user can access its API within a given timeframe, a measure to prevent abuse and ensure equitable distribution of resources. These limits can apply both at the user level and at the application level. For example, a single user may be allowed to make a certain number of requests per 15-minute interval, while an application may have a larger, separate limit that also operates over a longer timeframe.\n\nWhen these limits are exceeded, Twitter\'s servers respond with Status Code 429, effectively informing the user or application that they have made too many requests within the allowed timeframe. This is a temporary setback and the user or application should be able to make successful requests after a waiting period once the rate limit is reset. \n\nThis type of restriction is common across many web platforms and APIs, not only Twitter. It is a standard protocol of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) which governs how data is transferred and communicated on the web. To prevent this error, developers are advised to code their applications to handle this response appropriately, such as by implementing retries with exponential backoff, or reducing the frequency of their requests.']"

Advertisement Zillow is offering prospective homebuyers the option to put just a 1 % down payment on a home purchase amid an ongoing affordability crisis sparked by soaring mortgage rates.The 1 % Down Payment program from Zillow Home Loans is designed to reduce the time needed for consumers to save money for a down payment . For now , it 's only offered to eligible borrowers in Arizona , though the company intends to expand the program to other states . `` An analysis by Zillow Home Loans shows that by reducing the down payment burden to 1 % of the purchase price , a homebuyer looking to purchase a $ 275,000 home in Phoenix , Arizona , who makes 80 % of their area 's median income and saves 5 % of their income would only need 11 months to save for the down payment , '' Zillow said.By comparison , a similar homebuyer saving for a 3 % down payment would require 31 months to reach their savings goal . Advertisement Homebuyers typically aim for a 20 % down payment on a house to avoid the need to pay for private mortgage insurance , but plenty of consumers also opt to put a down payment of between 5 % and 20 % . The record-low 1 % down payment target offered by Zillow beats out Freddie Mac 's mortgage option of just a 3 % down payment . Zillow said it would contribute an additional 2 % to the down payment at closing for qualified borrowers . It 's not a payment to the borrower.But the 1 % down payment option does n't solve the housing affordability crisis , as smaller down payments lead to bigger monthly mortgage payments because borrowers have to take on more debt.And as long as interest rates stay high while home prices remain elevated , the affordability picture will not"", ""How the Presence and Type of Down Payment Assistance Affects the Performance of Affordable Mortgage Loans | Joint Center for Housing Studies Skip to main content AboutHistoryStaffPrevious DirectorsFellows & AdvisorsFacultyRetsinas DirectorshipPolicy Advisory BoardJob OpeningsResearchResearch CategoryHousing Markets & ConditionsAgingHomeownershipAffordabilityRental HousingDemographics & ProjectionsRemodelingNeighborhood ChangeSignature ReportsThe State of the Nation 's HousingImproving America 's HousingAmerica 's Rental HousingHousing America 's Older AdultsSpecial ProjectsBooksSymposia & Other ProjectsCalendarUpcoming EventsPrevious EventsJOHN T.

Read More Trending After Falling Last Year , Home Prices Are Rising Again Herbert Hoover ’ s Department of Commerce and the Origins of US Housing Data Home Prices and Interest Rates Still Rising , Shutting Out More Potential Homebuyers With Existing Inventories Historically Low , Homebuyers Turn to the New Home Market How the Presence and Type of Down Payment Assistance Affects the Performance of Affordable Mortgage Loans Monday , October 28 , 2019 | Michael Stegman Even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac returned to very-low down payment lending following the financial crisis , saving for a down payment remains one of the biggest barriers to obtaining a home mortgage . What is most striking about this return to high-leverage home lending is the proliferation of more than 2,500 privately sponsored and government-funded down payment assistance ( DPA ) programs across the country , which have the collective effect of reducing first-time homebuyers ’ contributions from as little as 3 percent to something substantially less . An indication of how important DPA has become to reaching the first rung on the homeownership ladder is that in FY2018 , approximately 43 percent of FHA first-time homebuyers relied on some form of down payment assistance , while for 18 of the 44 housing finance agencies rated by Moody ’ s , more than 90 percent of all production is now DPA-driven . Although research generally finds higher loan-to-value ratios increase default risk , few if any studies address the question of whether DPA in conjunction with very-low down payment purchase loans increases default risk to the point of warranting some form of corrective policy action , which is why HUD ’ s ongoing efforts to limit the sources and sponsors of DPA is so important . Specifically , citing generally higher early payment defaults ( EPD ) and serious delinquency rates ( SDQ ) for loans with DPA compared to those without DPA , HUD has announced that it is reserving DPA loans for special scrutiny where assistance is funded by a government program rather than from a relative or other source , because they perform the most poorly . FHA will evaluate this latter type to determine “ whether its current premium structure is commensurate with the risk the taxpayers are taking on. ” A serious limitation of HUD ’ s analysis is that it fails to take account of other risk factors unrelated to down payment assistance , such as the borrower ’ s demographic attributes , including credit score , which could lead to poorly designed and racially punitive corrective action . In this context , a newly-released paper I co-authored with Sarah F. Riley and Roberto G. Quercia , A Cautionary Tale of How the Presence and Type of Down Payment Assistance Affects the Performance of Affordable Mortgage Loans , sheds light on the relationship between different forms of DPA and default risk using multivariate methods applied to a well-documented national affordable lending data set from the Community Advantage Program ( CAP ) . Despite HUD ’ s stated concerns , my colleagues and I find that the receipt of down payment assistance is not significantly associated with default risk . Other significant findings from our paper are : Blacks are significantly less likely than whites to have received assistance from family or friends , but significantly more likely than whites to have received assistance via a second mortgage , or to have received a government or community grant ; In contrast to what is found by a simple descriptive analysis , the receipt of DPA is not significantly associated with default risk ; and Grant assistance from a government or community organization has a marginally significant association with default risk but this effect disappears when racial controls are incorporated in the model . This finding is significant because of the importance of DPA to minority borrowers , especially assistance in the form of grants and loans from government programs , rather than from friends and family . Since we find that CAP households with DPA were as able to benefit financially from rising markets as those without DPA , in setting guidelines around down payment assistance , policy makers should take care not to close off opportunities to aspiring minority homebuyers .

The 1% Down Payment program from Zillow Home Loans is currently only available to eligible borrowers in Arizona, with plans to expand it to other states. By reducing down payments to 1% of the purchase price, buyers would significantly cut the time used to save money for a down payment. However, critics argue that having a smaller down payment would result in larger monthly mortgage payments as the amount of borrowed debt increases.\n', 'The paper, ""How the Presence and Type of Down Payment Assistance Affects the Performance of Affordable Mortgage Loans,"" examines the impact of different forms of down payment assistance (DPA) on mortgage default risk. It reveals that receipt of DPA is not significantly associated with default risk. The authors found that African Americans are less likely than whites to have received assistance from family or friends but more likely to have received assistance via government/community grants or second mortgages. These findings could have significant implications for policies related to down payment assistance, particularly given the importance of such assistance to minority homebuyers.\n']"

Mr Zahawi 's statement does not make clear whether he paid a penalty or not as part of his settlement , nor does it say how much he paid to HMRC . He said when he was being appointed chancellor , questions were being raised about his tax affairs and he discussed it with the Cabinet Office at the time.The exact timing of when the matter was settled with HMRC remains unclear.Labour calls for Zahawi to be sacked over tax claimsIn the statement issued on Saturday afternoon , Mr Zahawi said : `` As a senior politician I know that scrutiny and propriety are important parts of public life . Twenty-two years ago I co-founded a company called YouGov . I 'm incredibly proud of what we achieved . It is an amazing business that has employed thousands of people and provides a world-beating service . `` When we set it up , I did n't have the money or the expertise to go it alone . So I asked my father to help . In the process , he took founder shares in the business in exchange for some capital and his invaluable guidance . `` Twenty one years later , when I was being appointed chancellor of the exchequer , questions were being raised about my tax affairs . I discussed this with the Cabinet Office at the time . `` Following discussions with HMRC , they agreed that my father was entitled to founder shares in YouGov , though they disagreed about the exact allocation . They concluded that this was a 'careless and not deliberate ' error . `` So that I could focus on my life as a public servant , I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due , which was the right thing to do . `` The questions facing Mr Zahawi include whether he tried to avoid paying tax by using an offshore company called Balshore Investments to hold shares in YouGov , the polling company he co-founded in 2000 - something he has always denied.Balshore Investments is registered offshore in Gibraltar.According to HMRC , tax avoidance involves bending the rules of the tax system to try to gain a tax advantage that Parliament never intended . It is legal and includes things that some people would consider to be normal tax planning . Tax avoidance is different from tax evasion , which is illegal . Penalties can be applied by HMRC if tax is not paid in the correct amount at the right time.In his statement , Mr Zahawi continues : `` Additionally , HMRC agreed with my accountants that I have never set up an offshore structure , including Balshore Investments , and that I am not the beneficiary of Balshore Investments . `` This matter was resolved prior to my appointments as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and subsequently chairman of the party I love so much .

Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said Mr Zahawi had been `` very transparent '' about the matter , saying : `` He has been clear that all of his tax owed to HMRC are up to date and paid in full . He added : `` If he needs to answer any further questions I 'm sure he 'll do so '' .Sunak quizzed about Zahawi tax allegationsHowever , Ms Rayner said : `` Nadhim Zahawi 's story does n't add up .

According to The Guardian , he has had to pay back the tax he owed with a 30 % penalty and the total amounts to £4.8m . The BBC has been unable to verify that figure , but when the Guardian asked repeatedly about the penalty , Mr Zahawi 's spokesperson did not deny one had been paid.When pressed on the total amount , which was thought to include the alleged penalty , the spokesperson said : `` Nadhim Zahawi does not recognise this amount … as he has previously stated , his taxes are properly declared and paid in the UK . `` The BBC has discovered that Balshore Investments was also registered as a `` beneficial owner '' of a UK crowdfunding firm called crowd2Fund for three years . Under transparency rules brought in by the coalition government in the UK , the firm should have made public who was personally in charge.That is because Balshore owns more than 25 % of Crowd2Fund 's shares.Although it is based in Gibraltar where beneficial ownership information is kept behind a paywall , the UK requires this to be made freely available to the public.Balshore was described as the `` family trust of Nadhim Zahawi , an executive director of YouGov '' , in the polling firm 's 2009 annual report . But the Conservative Party chairman has denied benefiting from or having any involvement with the company.A spokesperson for Mr Zahawi said it was a matter of public record that Balshore Investments is owned by his father , hence the YouGov reference to his family.In June 2020 , Crowd2Fund told Companies House that its Gibraltar-based shareholder had in fact ceased to be a beneficial owner in April 2016.Companies are supposed to update these details within 14 days . But Crowd2Fund appears to have taken four years to register the information . In June last year , Nadhim Zahawi 's parents were personally recorded as beneficial owners of Crowd2Fund which indicates they now control the Gibraltar firm.However , Balshore Investments has owned more than 25 % of Crowd2Fund 's shares since at least 2015.That leaves a gap in the register explaining who ultimately benefited from the shareholding prior to June 2022 . BBC News asked both Crowd2Fund and Balshore Investments to explain what happened and if they would now disclose who the beneficial owners of Balshore were for the relevant period . They were also asked if they accepted they may have broken the law if they failed to file the correct information with Companies House.Neither Balshore Investments or Crowd2Fund has so far responded to requests for comment.A spokesman for Mr Zahawi has previously said his taxes are `` properly declared and paid in the UK '' and the minister `` has never had to instruct any lawyers to deal with HMRC on his behalf '' .Related TopicsConservative PartyNadhim ZahawiMore on this storyZahawi 's position is 'untenable ' - Rayner .

Nor did they offer any explanation or clarification about the sums involved.In reference to the total amount paid to HMRC , the spokesperson said : “ Nadhim Zahawi does not recognise this amount … As he has previously stated , his taxes are properly declared and paid in the UK. ” If Zahawi has paid a penalty , it would be hugely embarrassing , given his previous role as chancellor in charge of the UK ’ s tax system.He has also been a member of a government that has made great efforts to ensure tax is paid in full and on time.Labour said Zahawi should quit because his story “ doesn ’ t add up ” .Earlier this week , the party called for an inquiry into whether Zahawi broke the ministerial code or misled the public over his tax affairs.A source familiar with the payment told the Guardian a penalty was triggered as a result of a non-payment of capital gains tax due after the sale of shares in YouGov , the polling company Zahawi co-founded . He could have been subject to larger penalties had he not reached a settlement towards the end of last year , they claim.Experts estimate the tax due was about £3.7m based on the capital gains tax incurred by the sale of multiple tranches of shares in YouGov worth more than £20m , which led to transfers of money to Zahawi.It is understood HMRC applied a 30 % penalty to the £3.7m , bringing the total due to £4.8m . Combined with interest charges that HMRC also applies to taxes owed , this is believed to have taken the final settlement to more than £5m.Last summer , news reports emerged about Zahawi ’ s financial affairs , including an HMRC look at his taxes . At the time , Zahawi described such reports as “ smears ” .It is understood that after those reports a representative for Zahawi approached HMRC to discuss his tax position.Michael Gove defended Zahawi on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday , saying : “ My firm understanding is HMRC have no quibble with Nadhim . He ’ s paid everything that he should , and , people paying their taxes , that ’ s not a story – people not paying their taxes , yeah that is a problem. ” skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day , telling you what ’ s happening and why it mattersPrivacy Notice : Newsletters may contain info about charities , online ads , and content funded by outside parties .

This follows reports of Zahawi avoiding tax and having to pay back owed amount, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reportedly satisfied with Zahawi\'s account of events.

Despite Zahawi stating that his tax obligations to HMRC are up to date and paid in full, Labour argues that his story does not add up. The controversy principally surrounds Balshore Investments, which Zahawi allegedly used to hold shares in YouGov, his co-founded company. The firm is registered offshore in Gibraltar.

Zahawi could have faced more substantial penalties if he had not reached this settlement, which included an estimated £5m tax bill. This tax bill is believed to be a result of non-payment of capital gains tax from the sale of shares in YouGov, a company Zahawi co-founded. Critics are calling for Zahawi's resignation, arguing that his actions don't align with the government's agenda of ensuring full and prompt tax payment.\n""]"

Status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the Internet. They help identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly. In this case, the 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (""rate limiting"").\n\nTwitter uses rate limiting to reduce the possibility of automated attacks on its platform. This is a common practice in web service APIs to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. Each Twitter account has certain rate limits, and once this limit is exceeded, Twitter\'s server will stop responding to the requests from that user for a certain period. That\'s why the message ""Failed to retrieve tweet"" appears.\n\nTherefore, if a user is trying to retrieve tweets and runs into this error, it means they\'ve made too many requests to Twitter\'s servers in a short period. To resolve the issue, they may need to wait until their rate limit resets or else reduce the frequency of their requests.\n\nThis specific error message is likely to be seen by developers creating applications that interact with Twitter or by high-volume users of Twitter\'s platform who depend heavily on retrieving tweets - particularly those involved in activities like data mining or analytics.']"

No other U.S. president , current or former , has ever faced criminal charges.The election probe was led by special counsel Jack Smith , who also oversaw a separate investigation into Trump 's retention of classified documents at his resort home Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House in 2021.Trump has pleaded not guilty in that case , which is set to go to trial in May.Follow our live coverage of Trump 's arraignment on four counts related to the 2020 election.Key points : Trump fundraises off indictment moments after its releaseSpecial counsel has `` contemporaneous notes '' from Pence of Trump meetingsDeSantis says he has n't read Trump indictment , but claims the government was 'weaponized'Trump case assigned to Judge Tanya Chutkan , an Obama appointeeHere are the four criminal charges Trump faces in new indictmentTrump charged with trying to subvert 2020 election via 3 criminal conspiraciesRead the full indictment against TrumpTue , Aug 1 20239:12 PM EDTTrump 's lawyer vows to use new charges to 're-litigate every single issue ' of the 2020 electionSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump gather in Presidents Park on the Ellipse by the White House for his rally and speech to contest the certification by the U.S. Congress of the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Washington , U.S , January 6 , 2021.Jim Bourg | ReutersAn attorney who is representing former President Donald Trump in his latest federal criminal indictment vowed to use the charges to `` re-litigate every single issue in the 2020 election in the context of this litigation . `` The case gives Trump `` an opportunity that he has never had before , which is to have subpoena power since January 6 in a way that can be exercised in federal court , '' attorney John Lauro said in a Fox News interview.Trump is charged with conspiring to overturn his election loss in the 2020 presidential race by pushing fraud claims he knew were false , which prosecutors say amounted to an effort to obstruct the electoral process.Lauro 's comments suggest that the former president 's legal strategy in this case could include an attempt by his lawyers to portray Trump 's myriad false claims of widespread election fraud in late 2020 as legitimate concerns at the time , regardless of whether or not they were correct.— Kevin BreuningerTue , Aug 1 20239:01 PM EDTWho are the Trump co-conspirators ?

It includes 39.06 sq mi ( 101.2 km2 ) within Orange and Osceola counties in Florida . It acts with most of the same authority and responsibility as a county government . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It includes the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista , as well as unincorporated land . The current district was created on February 27 , 2023 , after the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 9B to supersede the Reedy Creek Improvement Act , passed in 1967 at the behest of Walt Disney and his namesake media company during the planning stages of Walt Disney World . A major selling point in lobbying the Florida government to establish the original Reedy Creek Improvement District was Walt Disney 's proposal of the `` Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow '' ( EPCOT ) , a real planned community intended to serve as a testbed for new city-living innovations . However , the company eventually abandoned Walt Disney 's concepts for the experimental city , primarily only building a resort similar to its other parks . The Reedy Creek Improvement District had the authority of a governmental body , [ 3 ] but was not subject to the constraints of a governmental body . That changed under the 2023 act , which gave the Florida governor the authority to name its board members , replacing the original five-member Board of Supervisors controlled by the Walt Disney Company , the majority landowner of the District . In April 2022 , the Florida Legislature passed a law abolishing the RCID and other special districts formed before November 5 , 1968 . [ 4 ] Some members of the Florida Legislature and political commentators said the action was retaliation to Disney 's opposition to the controversial Parental Rights in Education Act , dubbed the `` Do n't Say Gay '' bill by its critics . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The law would have taken effect in June 2023 , at which time the RCID would be dissolved ; however , it was unclear what would happen to the $ 1 billion in bond liabilities held by the RCID . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] On February 9 and 10 , 2023 , the state legislature voted to revert most of the changes ; replace the RCID board 's five Disney-selected members with five members appointed by the governor ; and remove parts of the district 's authority , such as the power to construct a nuclear power plant , airport , and stadium . [ 2 ] The district 's name was changed the day the bill was signed into law [ 10 ] by Governor Ron DeSantis on February 27 , 2023 . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] On April 26 , 2023 , Disney filed a lawsuit against DeSantis . [ 13 ] History [ edit ] Creation [ edit ] Initial steps [ edit ] Logo as the Reedy Creek Improvement District After the success of Disneyland in California , Walt Disney began planning a second park on the East Coast . He disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland , and wanted control of a much larger area of land for the new project . [ 14 ] He flew over the Orlando-area site , and many other potential sites , in November 1963 . [ 15 ] Seeing the well-developed network of roads , including the planned Interstate 4 and Florida 's Turnpike , with McCoy Air Force Base ( later Orlando International Airport ) to the east , he selected a centrally located site near Bay Lake . He used multiple shell companies to buy up land , at very low prices , that eventually would be included within the district . These company names are listed on the upper story windows of what is now the Main Street USA section of Walt Disney World , including Compass East Corporation ; Latin-American Development and Management Corporation ; Ayefour Corporation ( named for nearby I-4 ) ;""]","['The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD), previously known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, is the jurisdiction and taxing authority over the property of Walt Disney World Resort, spanning over 39.06 square miles within Orange and Osceola Counties in Florida.

Its formation in 2023 replaced the Reedy Creek Improvement Act put forth in 1967 by Walt Disney during the development phase of Walt Disney World. However, the original concept for an ""Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow"" was discarded, resulting in a resort similar to others. The CFTOD\'s authority as a governing entity was established through a 2023 act, allowing Florida’s governor to appoint its board members, which was a switch from the previously Disney-controlled five-member Board of Supervisors. The district underwent a series of changes due to its opposition to certain controversial bills and was eventually renamed following a law enacted by Governor Ron DeSantis in February 2023. In retaliation, Disney lodged a lawsuit against DeSantis in April 2023.\n']"

[ 5 ] Proto-Germanic , in fact , had two nouns derived from this word , later merging into the modern English noun : * murþrą `` death , killing , murder '' ( directly from Proto-Indo-European * mŕ̥-trom ) , whence Old English morðor `` secret or unlawful killing of a person , murder ; mortal sin , crime ; punishment , torment , misery '' ; [ 6 ] and * murþrijô `` murderer ; homicide '' ( from the verb * murþrijaną `` to murder '' ) , giving Old English myrþra `` homicide , murder ; murderer '' . There was a third word for `` murder '' in Proto-Germanic , continuing Proto-Indo-European * mr̥tós `` dead '' ( compare Latin mors ) , giving Proto-Germanic * murþą `` death , killing , murder '' and Old English morþ `` death , crime , murder '' ( compare German Mord ) . The -d- first attested in Middle English mordre , mourdre , murder , murdre could have been influenced by Old French murdre , itself derived from the Germanic noun via Frankish * murþra ( compare Old High German murdreo , murdiro ) , though the same sound development can be seen with burden ( from burthen ) . The alternative murther ( attested up to the 19th century ) springs directly from the Old English forms . Middle English mordre is a verb from Anglo-Saxon myrðrian from Proto-Germanic * murþrijaną , or , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , from the noun . [ 7 ] Use of the term edit In many countries , out of concern for being accused of defamation , [ 8 ] journalists are generally careful not to identify a suspect as a murderer until the suspect is convicted of murder in a court of law . After arrest , for example , journalists may instead write that the person was `` arrested on suspicion of murder '' , [ 9 ] or , after a prosecutor files charges , as an `` accused murderer '' . [ 10 ] Opponents of abortion consider abortion a form of murder . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In some countries , a fetus is a legal person who can be murdered , and killing a pregnant woman is considered a double homicide . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Definition edit The eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone ( citing Edward Coke ) , in his Commentaries on the Laws of England set out the common law definition of murder , which by this definition occurs when a person , of sound memory and discretion , unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the king 's peace , with malice aforethought , either express or implied . [ 15 ] At common law , murder was normally punishable by death . [ 16 ] The elements of common law murder are : unlawful killing through criminal act or omission of a human by another human intentional killing with malice aforethought . [ 17 ] Unlawful – This distinguishes murder from killings that are done within the boundaries of law , such as capital punishment , justified self-defense , or the killing of enemy combatants by lawful combatants as well as causing collateral damage to non-combatants during a war .

Differing from manslaughter, murder is usually committed with a high level of intent or malice. Societies often consider it a significant crime, punishable by long-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and capital punishment in some countries. The term itself has origins in the Proto-Indo-European language and has evolved into its modern English equivalent. Care is often taken in media not to label suspects as murderers until they are convicted. The article also explores additional factors surrounding the term, such as religious and societal attitudes, how it differs legally from other types of killing, degrees of murder, and the etymology of the word itself.\n', ""Exodus 20:13-17 is a portion of the Holy Bible that lists five of the Ten Commandments, which are divine laws given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. These commandments represent moral and ethical guidelines for humans to lead a righteous life. The commandments mentioned in these verses forbid the acts of murder, adultery, theft, and false witness against one's neighbor. Murder, here, refers to the intentional killing of a person. Adultery refers to any unfaithful activities within a marital relationship. The prohibition of theft commands against illegally taking something that belongs to someone else. Bearing false witness relates to deceit or lie told about someone else to harm them, especially in legal contexts.\n\nThe final commandment in this passage discourages coveting - a strong desire to possess what belongs to your neighbor. This includes anything that your neighbor owns such as his house, wife, servants, livestock, or any other property. These commandments emphasize respect for life, marital fidelity, personal property rights, truthfulness, and contentment with what one has. Overall, they represent key principles within the Judeo-Christian ethical and moral framework. Apart from their religious significance, these injunctions have influenced legal, ethical, and moral codes across the globe. They provide a foundation for justice, respect for the rights of others, and personal responsibility in many societies.""]"

Senator Susan Collins released this statement today following the Senate ’ s vote to advance the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett : “ When the Senate considers nominees to the United States Supreme Court , it is particularly important that we act fairly and consistently , using the same set of rules , no matter which political party is in power . “ When President Obama nominated Judge Garland eight months before the 2016 presidential election , I met with him and maintained that he was entitled to a hearing . Others argued that the winner of that year ’ s presidential election should be allowed to choose the nominee , and that is what happened . My views did not prevail , and the standard was established that a nominee to the Court would not be voted on prior to the election in a presidential election year . This year , a vacancy has also occurred , notably much closer to the election . “ Prior to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’ s death , I stated that , should a vacancy on the Supreme Court arise , the Senate should follow the precedent set four years ago and not vote on a nominee prior to the presidential election . Since her passing , I have reiterated that in fairness to the American people -- who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one -- the decision on the nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy should be made by whoever is elected on November 3rd . “ Because this vote is occurring prior to the election , I will vote against the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett . To be clear , my vote does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge Barrett ’ s qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court . What I have concentrated on is being fair and consistent , and I do not think it is fair nor consistent to have a Senate confirmation vote prior to the election. ” # # # Print Email Share Tweet Previous Next About Newsroom Issues Services Contact Privacy Policy Senator Collins Facebook Senator Collins Twitter Senator Collins Instagram About About Senator Collins Maine Facts Our State Newsroom Press Releases Weekly Columns Videos Issues Defense & National Security Education Energy & Environment Health Care Homeland Security Jobs & Economy Senior Issues Transportation Veterans Services Help With A Federal Agency Invitations & Meeting Requests Fellowships , Internships & Page Program Service Academy Nominations Order A Flag Tours & Visits Veterans Appropriations & CDS Requests Funding Maine 's Future Contact Email Senator Collins Request Assistance Scheduling Request website-search Site Search""]","[""U.S Senator Susan Collins issued a statement regarding the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Collins expressed the need for fairness and consistency in the Senate’s treatment of Supreme Court nominees, stating that the same set of rules should be applied, irrespective of which political party is in power. Referencing the Senate's refusal to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, prior to the 2016 Presidential election, Collins asserted that the same standard should be applied to Barrett’s nomination, due to its proximity to the 2020 presidential election.

HPVワクチンの接種はどのようなものですか？ 小学校６年～高校１年相当の女子は、予防接種法に基づく定期接種として、公費によりHPVワクチンを接種することができます。 現在、公費で受けられるHPVワクチンは、３種類（２価ワクチン（サーバリックス）、４価ワクチン（ガーダシル）、９価ワクチン（シルガード９））あります。一定の間隔をあけて、同じ種類のワクチンを合計２回または３回接種します。接種するワクチンや年齢によって、接種のタイミングや回数が異なります。どのワクチンを接種するかは、接種する医療機関に相談してください。 また、平成９年度生まれ～平成18年度生まれ（誕生日が1997年4月2日～2007年4月1日）の女性の中で、定期接種の対象年齢（小学校６年～高校１年相当）の間に接種を逃した方には、あらためて公費での接種の機会を提供しています。詳しくは「HPVワクチンの接種を逃した方へ～キャッチアップ接種のご案内～」をご覧ください。 問2-3 . 子宮頸がん検診はどのようなものですか？ 20歳以上の女性は、2年に1回の頻度で子宮頸がん検診を受けることが推奨されています。一般的に、子宮頸部の細胞を採取して、細胞に何らかの異常がないか検査する「子宮頸部細胞診」が行われています。検診を受けられる場所など詳細については、お住まいの市区町村にお問い合わせください。 問2-4 . HPVワクチンの接種場所など、必要な情報はどこに問い合わせたらよいですか？ 予防接種法に基づくワクチンの接種は、地域の実情に合わせて各市区町村が実施しています。お住まいの地域における接種方法などの詳細については、お住まいの市区町村の予防接種担当課にお問い合わせください。 問2-5 . HPVワクチンは絶対に受けなければならないものですか？ HPVワクチンの接種は予防接種法に基づいて実施されており、国内外の研究結果から、HPVワクチン接種による子宮頸がんの予防効果などのメリットが、副反応などのデメリットよりも大きいことを確認して、皆さまに接種をお勧めしています。 しかし、接種は強制ではなく、あくまでご本人の意思に基づき接種を受けていただくものです。接種を望まない方に接種を強制することはありません。また、接種対象者やその保護者の同意なく、接種が行われることはありません。 実際に予防接種を受ける際は、ワクチンの効果とリスクを十分に理解した上で、受けるかどうかご判断ください。ワクチンの効果とリスクについてはHPVワクチンに関するリーフレットもご参照ください。 また、HPVワクチンについて不安や疑問があるときは、お住まいの都道府県に設置された相談窓口にご相談いただけます。 問2-6 . HPVワクチンは何回接種すればよいですか？ HPVワクチンは、合計２回または３回接種します。接種するワクチンや年齢によって、接種のタイミングや回数が異なります。次の（１）または（２）の接種回数および間隔で行います。 （１）標準的な接種回数および間隔 （２）標準的な接種方法をとることができない場合の間隔 （１）の標準的な接種間隔以外でも、小学校6年生～高校1年生相当の年度の間に、公費で以下のとおりHPVワクチンを受けることもできます。 ●サーバリックス １か月以上の間隔をあけて２回接種し、１回目の接種から５か月以上かつ２回目の接種から２か月半以上の間隔をあけて３回目の接種を受けます。 ●ガーダシル １か月以上の間隔をあけて２回接種し、２回目の接種から３か月以上の間隔をあけて３回目の接種を受けます。 ●シルガード９ １回目の接種を15歳になるまでに受ける場合、少なくとも５か月以上あけて２回接種します（合計２回で完了）。 １回目の接種を15歳になってから受ける場合、１か月以上の間隔をあけて２回接種し、２回目の接種から３か月以上の間隔をあけて３回目の接種を受けます（合計３回で完了）。 問2-7 . HPVワクチンの定期接種の対象年齢を過ぎてからでも、接種できますか？ 定期接種の対象であった方々の中には、HPVワクチンの公費での接種機会を逃した方がいらっしゃいます。こうした方に、公平な接種機会を確保する観点から、定期接種の対象年齢（小学校６年～高校１年相当）を超えて、あらためて公費での接種の機会をご提供しています。 平成９年度～平成18年度生まれ（誕生日が1997年4月2日～2007年4月1日）（※）の女性で、過去にHPVワクチンの接種を合計３回受けていない方が対象です。対象者は、令和４ ( 2022 ) 年４月～令和７ ( 2025 ) 年３月の３年間、HPVワクチンを公費で接種できます。詳しくは「HPVワクチンの接種を逃した方へ～キャッチアップ接種のご案内～」をご覧ください。 （※）このほか、平成19 ( 2007 ) 年度生まれの方は、通常の接種対象の年齢を超えても、令和７ ( 2025 ) 年３月末まで接種できます。 対象者に該当しない方でも、任意接種としてHPVワクチンを接種することは可能です。お近くの医療機関などにご相談ください。ただし、この場合、予防接種法に基づく定期接種（公費での接種）の対象ではないため、接種費用は全額自己負担となります。 問2-8 . HPVワクチンを１回または２回接種してから１年を過ぎてしまいました。次の接種はどうすればよいですか？ 数年以上の接種間隔があいた後にHPVワクチンを接種した場合も、一定程度の効果と安全性が示されています。また、海外の保健当局においても、規定の間隔から外れてしまった場合でも、接種をやり直す必要はないとされています。 十分な予防効果を得るためには、決められた回数を完了させることが大切ですので、できるだけ早めに残りの接種を受けるようにしてください。 問2-9 . HPVワクチンはどれくらい効くのですか？ ２価ワクチン（サーバリックス）および４価ワクチン（ガーダシル）は、HPVの中でも子宮頸がんをおこしやすい種類（型）であるHPV16型と18型の感染を防ぐことができます。そのことにより、子宮頸がんの原因の50～70％を防ぎます。 ９価ワクチン（シルガード９）は、HPV16型と18型に加え、31型、33型、45型、52型、58型の感染も防ぐため、子宮頸がんの原因の80～90 % を防ぎます。 海外や日本で行われた疫学調査（集団を対象として病気の発生などを調べる調査）では 、HPVワクチンを導入することにより、子宮頸がんの前がん病変を予防する効果が示されています。また、接種が進んでいる一部の国では、子宮頸がんそのものを予防する効果があることもわかってきています。 問2-10 . 海外でのHPVワクチンの使用状況を教えてください。 世界保健機関（WHO）がHPVワクチンの接種を推奨しており、2022年12月時点では、120か国以上で公的な予防接種が行われています。カナダ、イギリス、オーストラリアなどの接種率は８割以上です。 ＜HPVワクチンを接種した女子の割合（2021年）＞ 問2-11 . 子宮頸がん検診とHPVワクチンは両方受けなければいけませんか？ 子宮頸がん検診、ワクチンともに有効な子宮頸がんの予防方法で、どちらも受けることが重要です。ワクチンはすべての高リスク型HPVの感染を予防できるわけではないため、早期発見・早期治療のために子宮頸がん検診も定期的に受診し、子宮頸がんに対する予防効果を高めることが大切です。特に20～30歳代で発症する子宮頸がんを予防するためには、ワクチンの効果が期待されています。 問2-12 . HPVワクチンについて、がんを予防する効果は証明されていないのですか？ 子宮頸がんは、数年から数十年にわたって、持続的にヒトパピローマウイルス（HPV）に感染した結果として発症するとされています。 海外や日本で行われた疫学調査（集団を対象として病気の発生などを調べる調査）では 、HPVワクチンを導入することにより、子宮頸がんの前がん病変を予防する効果が示されています。また、接種が進んでいる一部の国では、子宮頸がんそのものを予防する効果があることも分かってきています。 問2-13 . HPVワクチンは痛いのですか？ HPVワクチンは、筋肉注射という方法で接種します。接種を受けた部分の痛みや腫れ、赤みなどの症状が起こることがあります。 接種を受けた部分の痛み（疼痛）は、50％以上の頻度で発生するとされていますが、多くの場合は数日程度でおさまります。 接種後に体調の変化や気になる症状が現れたら、まずはワクチンを受けた医療機関などの医師にご相談ください。 問2-14 . HPVワクチン接種後に副反応はありますか？ HPVワクチン接種後に見られる主な副反応として、発熱や接種した部位の痛みや腫れ、注射による痛み、恐怖、興奮などをきっかけとした失神などが挙げられます。 【HPVワクチン接種後の主な副反応】 また、ワクチン接種後に見られる副反応が疑われる症状については、接種との因果関係を問わず収集しており、定期的に専門家が分析・評価しています。その中には、稀に重い症状の報告もあり、具体的には以下のとおりとなっています。 問2-15 . HPVワクチン接種後に報告されている「多様な症状」はどのようなものですか？ HPVワクチン接種後に、広い範囲に広がる痛みや、手足の動かしにくさ、不随意運動（動かそうと思っていないのに体の一部が勝手に動いてしまうこと）等を中心とする「多様な症状」が起きたことが副反応疑い報告により報告されています。 この症状は、何らかの身体症状はあるものの、画像検査や血液検査を受けた結果、その身体症状に合致する異常所見が見つからない状態である「機能性身体症状」であることが考えられています。 症状としては、➀知覚に関する症状（頭や腰、関節等の痛み、感覚が鈍い、しびれる、光に対する過敏など）、➁運動に関する症状（脱力、歩行困難、不随意運動など）、➂自律神経等に関する症状（倦怠感、めまい、睡眠障害、月経異常など）、➃認知機能に関する症状（記憶障害、学習意欲の低下、計算障害、集中力の低下など）など様々な症状が報告されています。 なお、「HPVワクチン接種後の局所の疼痛や不安等が機能性身体症状を起こすきっかけとなったことは否定できないが、接種後１か月以上経過してから発症している人は、接種との因果関係を疑う根拠に乏しい」と専門家により評価されています。 また、HPVワクチンの接種歴のない方においても、HPVワクチン接種後に報告されている症状と同様の「多様な症状」を有する方が一定数存在したことが明らかとなっています。 このような「多様な症状」の報告を受け、様々な調査研究が行われていますが、「ワクチン接種との因果関係がある」という証明はされていません。 問2-16 . HPVワクチン接種後に気になる症状が出た場合、どこに相談すればよいですか？ 接種後に体調の変化や気になる症状が現れたら、まずは接種を行った医療機関などの医師にご相談ください。また、HPVワクチン接種後に生じた症状の診療を行う協力医療機関（※）をお住まいの都道府県ごとに設置しています。協力医療機関の受診は、接種を行った医師又はかかりつけの医師にご相談ください。 なお、HPVワクチンは合計２回または３回接種しますが、１回目または２回目の接種後に気になる症状が現れた場合は、２回目以降の接種をやめることができます。 （※）協力医療機関についての詳細は「ヒトパピローマウイルス感染症の予防接種後に生じた症状の診療に係る協力医療機関について」のページをご覧ください。 問2-17 . HPVワクチンを受ける際に注意することはありますか？ 次のいずれかに該当する方は、特に、健康状態や体質などを担当の医師にしっかり伝え、予防接種の必要性、リスク、効果について十分な説明を受け、よく理解した上で接種を受けてください。 ●血小板が減少している、出血した際に止まりにくいなどの症状のある方 ●心臓血管系疾患、腎臓疾患、肝臓疾患、血液疾患、発育障害などの基礎疾患のある方 ●予防接種で接種後2日以内に発熱のみられた方 ●過去にけいれんの既往のある方 ●妊娠または妊娠している可能性のある方 ●ワクチンを接種した後や、けがの後等に原因不明の痛みが続いたことがある方 また、接種部位には主に、腕の肩に近い外側の部分（三角筋）が選ばれるので、接種当日はこの部分を露出しやすい服装にしてください。 問2-18 . 新型コロナワクチンを接種した（したい）のですが、HPVワクチンと同時期に接種することはできますか ? 原則として、新型コロナワクチンとそれ以外のワクチンは、同時に接種できません。互いに、片方のワクチンを受けてから２週間後に接種できます。 詳しくは「新型コロナワクチンQ & A」をご覧ください。 問2-19 . HPVワクチン接種後に注意することはありますか？ 針を刺した直後から、強い痛みやしびれが生じた場合は、担当の医師にすぐに伝えて、針を抜いてもらうなどの対応をしてもらってください。また、その後の対応についても相談してください。 予防接種直後に、注射による痛み、恐怖、興奮などをきっかけとした失神が現れることがあります。失神し、倒れて怪我をする例も報告されているため、接種後の移動の際には、保護者の方が腕を持つなどして付き添うようにし、接種後30分ほどは体重を預けられるような場所で、なるべく立ち上がることを避けて、待機して様子を見るようにしてください。 その他、予防接種一般に言えますが、予防接種当日は激しい運動は避け、接種部位を清潔に保ち、また、接種後の体調管理をしっかり行ってください。接種部位の異常や体調の変化、さらに高熱、けいれん、長期間持続する激しい痛みなどの異常な症状を呈した場合は、すぐに医師の診察を受けてください。 また、接種後に気になる症状が現れたときは、以降の接種を中止、延期することが可能です。気になる症状があれば、担当の医師に相談してください。 問2-20 . 予防接種されるワクチンの安全性はどのようにチェックしていますか？ ワクチンの安全性については、その他の医薬品と同様に、販売されるまでに安全性に関する承認審査を行っている他、ワクチンはウイルスや細菌など生物をもとに作っていることもあり、その後も製品（ロット）ごとに国による検定を行っています。 また、予防接種後に健康状況の変化が見られた事例を、予防接種との因果関係の有無に関わらず収集し、随時モニタリングしています。さらに、収集したこれらの情報について、定期的に専門家による評価を実施して安全性の評価を行っています。 問2-21 . 予防接種を受けた後に体調が悪くなり、医療機関を受診しました。救済などはありますか？ HPVワクチンに限らず、予防接種法に基づくワクチン接種については、接種によって、医療機関での治療が必要になったり、生活に支障が出るような障害が残るなどの健康被害が生じた場合は、申請し認定されると、予防接種法に基づく救済（医療費・障害年金等の給付）を受けられます。 給付申請を検討する場合には、診察した医師、保健所、お住まいの市区町村の予防接種担当課へご相談ください。 ※なお、救済に当たっては、その健康被害が予防接種によって引き起こされたものか、別の原因によって起こったものなのか、専門家からなる国の審査会で、因果関係についての審議が行われます。 ※予防接種健康被害救済制度の詳細については、「予防接種健康被害救済制度について」をご覧ください。 ワクチン接種後の症状に対する医療体制について 問3-1 . ワクチン接種後に生じた症状に対する診療体制はどうなっていますか？ HPVワクチンの接種後に生じた症状については、より身近な地域において患者さんに適切な診療を提供するため、各都道府県において協力医療機関が選定されています。ワクチン接種後に気になる症状が出たときは、まずは接種を受けた医師やかかりつけの医師など地域の医療機関を受診してください。その際、必要に応じて、協力医療機関の受診について相談してください。 ９価ワクチン（シルガード９）について 問4-1 . ２価ワクチン（サーバリックス）または４価ワクチン（ガーダシル）を接種すると、９価ワクチン（シルガード９）は接種できないのですか？ ○サーバリックスまたはガーダシルで規定の回数（３回）接種が完了している場合 世界保健機関（WHO）や米国疾病予防管理センター（CDC）は、シルガード９の追加の接種を推奨していません。これは、サーバリックスまたはガーダシルでも、子宮頸がんに最も関与の強い型であるHPV16/18型（※）の感染予防に効果があることや、異なる種類のワクチンを接種した場合の有効性と安全性についてのデータが限られていることからです。 （※）HPV16/18型が子宮頸がんの原因の50～70 % を占めます。 ○サーバリックスまたはガーダシルを１回または２回接種している場合 原則として同じ種類のワクチンを接種することをお勧めしますが、医師と相談のうえ、途中からシルガード９に変更し、残りの接種を完了させることができます（※）。この場合も定期接種の対象となります。また、キャッチアップ接種の対象の方も、途中からシルガード９に変更し、残りの接種を完了させることができます。 なお、サーバリックスまたはガーダシルで接種を開始し、定期接種としてシルガード９で接種を完了させる場合は、シルガード９の接種方法にあわせ、１回目と２回目の間隔を１か月以上、２回目と３回目の間隔を３か月以上あけて接種します。 （※）異なる種類のワクチンを接種した場合の効果と安全性についてのデータは限られています。 問4-2 . 年齢によってシルガード９の接種回数が異なるのはなぜですか？ シルガード９を合計２回の接種で完了する用法については、９～14歳の女性を対象に臨床試験が行われ、効果と安全性が確認されたうえで薬事承認がなされており、シルガード９を２回接種した９～14歳の方における有効性は、３回接種した方と比べて、劣ってはいないことが報告されています。また、米国やカナダ、オーストラリアなどの諸外国では、原則、15歳になるまでに１回目の接種を終えていれば、２回で接種完了としています。 これらの背景から、15歳になるまでに1回目の接種を行った方は、2回で接種を完了できることとしています。なお、シルガード９を含め、HPVワクチンの定期接種は小学校６年～高校１年相当の女子が対象であり、標準的な接種期間は、中学校１年（13歳になる学年）の女子となっています。 問4-3 . 定期接種またはキャッチアップ接種の対象者ですが、令和５年３月31日までに任意接種としてシルガード９の接種を受けました。接種にかかった費用の払い戻し（償還払い）を受けることはできますか？ 国の制度としては、シルガード９は償還払いの対象ではありません。２価ワクチン（サーバリックス）や４価ワクチン（ガーダシル）とは異なり、シルガード９は令和５年３月31日まで、予防接種法に基づく定期接種（公費での接種）の対象ではなかったためです。ただし、自治体によっては、独自にシルガード９の償還払いを実施している場合がありますので、詳しくはお住まいの市町村にご確認ください。 HPVワクチンの接種を逃した方への接種機会の提供について（キャッチアップ接種） 問5-1 . なぜ、平成９年度～平成17年度生まれの女性に、あらためて接種の機会が設けられているのですか？ 平成25 ( 2013 ) 年から令和３（2021）年の、HPVワクチンの接種を個別にお勧めする取組が差し控えられていた間（※１）に、定期接種の対象であった方々の中には、HPVワクチンの公費での接種機会を逃した方がいらっしゃいます。こうした方に、公平な接種機会を確保する観点から、定期接種の対象年齢（小学校６年～高校１年相当）を超えて、あらためて公費での接種の機会をご提供しています。 対象は、平成９年度～平成18年度生まれ（誕生日が1997年4月2日～2007年4月1日）（※２）の女性で、過去にHPVワクチンの接種を合計３回受けていない方です。令和４（2022）年４月～令和７ ( 2025 ) 年３月の３年間、HPVワクチンを公費で接種できます。 （※１）接種後に生じうる多様な症状等について十分に情報提供できない状況にあったことから、個別に接種をお勧めする取組を一時的に差し控えていました。令和３（2021）年11月の専門家の会議で、安全性について特段の懸念が認められないことがあらためて確認され、接種による有効性が副反応のリスクを明らかに上回ると認められたことから、個別に接種をお勧めする取組を再開することになりました。 （※２）このほか、平成19 ( 2007 ) 年度生まれの方は、通常の接種対象の年齢を超えても、令和７ ( 2025 ) 年３月末まで接種できます。 問5-2 . 通常の定期接種の対象年齢（高校１年相当まで）を過ぎても、接種の効果はありますか？ 16歳頃までに接種するのが最も効果が高いですが、それ以上の年齢で接種しても、ある程度の有効性があることが、国内外の研究で示されています（※）。 なお、定期接種の対象年齢を過ぎてからの接種について、明らかな安全性の懸念は示されていません。 また、子宮頸がんの予防のためには、子宮頸がん検診を定期的に受診することも大切です。検診を定期的に受けることで、がんの早期発見・早期治療につながります。さらに、HPV感染は主に性的接触により起こるため、パートナーとともに性感染症の予防も忘れずに行いましょう。 （※）ワクチンが子宮病変を予防する有効性はおおむね16歳以下の接種で最も高いものの、20歳頃の初回接種まではある程度有効性が保たれることや、性交経験がない場合はそれ以上の年齢についても一定程度の有効性があることが示されています。性交経験によるHPV感染によって、ワクチンの予防効果が減少することが示されていますが、性交経験がある場合でも、ワクチンの予防効果がなくなってしまうわけではありません。 HPVワクチンの対象年齢を過ぎてからの接種の有効性などに関するエビデンスについて、以下をご参照ください。 第26回厚生科学審議会予防接種・ワクチン分科会 資料５－１「HPVワクチンのキャッチアップ接種に関する有効性・安全性のエビデンスについて」 問5-3 . キャッチアップ接種の対象者がHPVワクチンを接種するときに、保護者の同意は必要でしょうか？ 予防接種法上、ワクチンの接種にあたって保護者の同意が必要となるのは16 歳未満の方です。そのため、キャッチアップ接種の対象者は、保護者の同意は不要となります。 問5-4 . 過去にHPVワクチンを１回または２回接種した場合にも、残りの回数を公費で受けられますか？ １回接種したことがある方は残り２回、２回接種したことがある方は残り１回、公費で接種を受けられます。 過去にHPVワクチンを受けた時から時間が経過している場合でも、接種を初回からやり直す必要はなく、残りの回数の接種（２、３回目または３回目）を行ってください。 なお、HPVワクチンは、原則、同じ種類のワクチンを用いて３回（※）接種することとなっています。 （※）シルガード９は、15歳未満の方は接種回数が異なります。 問5-5 . 予防接種を受けた後に体調が悪くなり、医療機関を受診しました。救済などはありますか？ HPVワクチンのキャッチアップ接種は、予防接種法に基づく接種になります。 HPVワクチンに限らず、接種によって、医療機関での治療が必要になったり、生活に支障が出るような障害が残るなどの健康被害が生じた場合は、申請し認定されると、予防接種法に基づく救済（医療費・障害年金等の給付）を受けられます。 給付申請を検討する場合には、診察した医師、保健所、お住まいの市町村の予防接種担当課へご相談ください。 ※なお、救済に当たっては、その健康被害が予防接種によって引き起こされたものか、別の原因によって起こったものなのか、専門家からなる国の審査会で、因果関係についての審議が行われます。 ※予防接種健康被害救済制度の詳細については、「予防接種健康被害救済制度について」をご覧ください。 積極的な勧奨の差し控えについて 問6-1 . 予防接種対象者への積極的な勧奨が差し控えられていたのはなぜでしょうか？ 平成25（2013）年4月にHPVワクチンが定期接種化されてから、接種部位以外の体の広い範囲で持続する疼痛等が報告されました。これを受けて、HPVワクチンの副反応について、平成25（2013）年６月14日に開催された専門家の会議において、これまでに収集された医学的情報をもとに分析・評価され、ワクチン接種の効果と比較した上で、定期接種を中止するほどリスクが高いとは評価されませんでした。 その会議では、接種部位以外の体の広い範囲で持続する疼痛の副反応症例等について十分に情報提供できない状況にあることから、接種希望者の接種機会は確保しつつ、適切な情報提供ができるまでの間は、積極的な勧奨を一時的に差し控えるべきとされました。 問6-2 . 予防接種対象者への積極的な勧奨が差し控えられている状態が終了したのはなぜでしょうか？ HPVワクチンの接種については、専門家の会議において継続的に議論されてきました。令和３（2021）年11月12日に開催された会議において、安全性について特段の懸念が認められないことが確認され、接種による有効性が副反応のリスクを明らかに上回ると認められました。また、引き続きHPVワクチンの安全性の評価を行っていくこと、接種後に生じた症状の診療に係る協力医療機関の診療実態の継続的な把握や体制強化を行っていくこと、都道府県や地域の医療機関等の関係機関の連携を強化し地域の支援体制を充実させていくこと、ワクチンについての情報提供を充実させていくことなどを進め、積極的な勧奨を差し控えている状態を終了させることが妥当であると判断されました。 こうした専門家の意見を踏まえ、令和３（2021）年11月26日に差し控えの状態を終了させることとなり、基本的に令和４（2022）年４月から個別の勧奨（個別に接種のお知らせを送る取組）を順次行うことになりました。 問6-3 . 積極的な勧奨が差し控えられている状態が終了しましたが、具体的にどのようにかわったのでしょうか？ Ａ類疾病（ヒトパピローマウイルス感染症もその１つです。）の定期接種については、予防接種法に基づき市町村が接種対象者やその保護者に対して、接種を受けるよう勧奨しなければならないものとしています。 具体的には、市町村は接種対象者やその保護者に対して、広報紙や、ポスター、インターネットなどを利用して接種可能なワクチンや、接種対象年齢などについて広報を行うことを指しています。 「積極的な勧奨」とは、市町村が接種対象者やその保護者に対して、標準的な接種期間の前に、接種を促すハガキや予診票等を各家庭に送ること等により接種をお勧めする取り組みを指しています。（※） （※）HPVワクチンの場合、標準的接種年齢（中学１年相当）を迎える前に個別に通知することが一般的です。詳しくは、お住まいの市区町村の予防接種担当課へご相談ください。 問6-4 . 接種対象者への周知はどのように行われているのですか？ リーフレットを用い、ワクチンの効果と安全性に関する情報提供に取り組んでいます。具体的には、HPVワクチンの接種について検討・判断いただくために必要なワクチンの効果と安全性に関する情報や、接種を希望した場合の円滑な接種のために必要な情報等をお届けするため、リーフレット等のお知らせが、接種対象者及びその保護者に個別に送付されています。接種を促すハガキや予診票等をそれぞれのご家庭にお届けすること等により、接種をお勧めする取り組みが行われています。

The account was “ permanently suspended for repeated violations of Twitter ’ s private information policy , ” a Twitter spokesperson said . The group ’ s founder , James O ’ Keefe , had his account temporarily locked , also for violation of the private information policy . “ The account owner is required to delete the violative Tweet to regain access to their account , ” the spokesperson said . O ’ Keefe on Thursday explained his and Project Veritas ’ positions . “ Late last night , Twitter locked Project Veritas ’ s and my Twitter accounts , claiming we violated Twitter Guidelines by posting a video of our journalists asking questions of Facebook ’ s Vice President Guy Rosen which Rosen refused to answer , ” he said in an emailed statement . “ Twitter claimed the video published private information , which is false . Twitter invited Project Veritas to , and we did , appeal that decision with Twitter . In an apparent act of retaliation for daring to question their authority , Twitter responded to our appeal by suspending our account , continuing to tell us that Project Veritas could delete the tweet and have our account reinstated. ” O ’ Keefe added that he would not delete the tweet . The Project Veritas account had been followed by former President Donald Trump ’ s adult sons , and the suspensions come amid a broader Twitter crackdown on accounts promoting misinformation . Last month following the Capitol insurrection , the social media platform announced that it had removed more than 70,000 accounts that promoted QAnon ideas , along with banning Trump . Sens . Amy Klobuchar ( D-Minn. ) , Tammy Baldwin ( D-Wis. ) and Gary Peters ( D-Mich. ) also recently sent a letter to the CEOs of Twitter , Google , Youtube and Facebook , emphasizing the need for clear and accurate information as coronavirus vaccines roll out . Project Veritas has been known to use deceptive practices and spread misinformation in attempts to expose what it views as “ corruption , dishonesty , self-dealing , waste , fraud , and other misconduct ” from liberal organizations or individuals . In September , Stanford University and University of Washington researchers wrote that a Project Veritas video alleging voter fraud with unidentified sources was what a “ a domestic , coordinated elite disinformation campaign looks like in the United States. ” O ’ Keefe had also filmed himself crashing a private CNN teleconference in December .

As a part of their demonstration, these activists adopted the extreme tactic of supergluing themselves to the streets, in order to block traffic and draw attention to their cause. Their aim is to push for urgent actions to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe video did not provide any specfic details about which activist group was involved or the exact number of participants in this particular protest. The incident, however, is a part of a larger global movement of climate activism, with individuals and organizations adopting unconventional methods to convey their message and demand concrete action from political leaders and policymakers.\n\nThe video brings into focus the increasing desperation and frustration of these activists, who feel that traditional methods of protest are no longer effective in prompting swift and significant policy changes. Using superglue as a form of protest may be seen as extreme and disruptive, but it reflects the severity of the environmental crisis as perceived by the activists.\n\nOverall, the video captures a dramatic manifestation of the global climate protest movement in Berlin. It sends a strong signal to the viewers about the extent to which some activists are willing to go to ensure their call for urgent action on climate change is heard within the public sphere and by those in power.']"

La tranche d ’ âge des Québécois de 0 à 49 ans a connu plus de décès que prévu depuis le début de l ’ année , démontrent les dernières données publiées par l ’ Institut de la statistique . Si des pistes d ’ explication sont avancées pour expliquer cet écart – comme l ’ impact de la crise des opioïdes – , il est encore trop tôt pour statuer sur les causes exactes . Mis à jour le 8 oct. 2023 Nicolas Bérubé La Presse Décès en hausse La surmortalité s ’ accélère chez les Québécois de moins de 50 ans cet automne . C ’ est ce qu ’ ont révélé les toutes dernières données publiées jeudi par l ’ Institut de la statistique du Québec ( ISQ ) . Depuis le début de l ’ année , l ’ ISQ prévoyait enregistrer 1991 décès en date de la mi-septembre chez les 0 à 49 ans . À cette date , les décès étaient plutôt au nombre de 2450 , un écart de 23 % par rapport aux prévisions des démographes . La surmortalité ( ou « excès de mortalité » ) est définie par l ’ Institut national de santé publique du Québec comme « le nombre de décès de toutes causes qui excède le nombre attendu “ en temps normal ” » . Grandes fluctuations PHOTO PATRICE LAROCHE , ARCHIVES LE SOLEIL Frédéric Fleury-Payeur , démographe de l ’ Institut de la statistique du Québec Le petit nombre de décès dans ce groupe d ’ âge dans une province de près de 9 millions d ’ habitants fait en sorte que chaque variation aura des impacts très visibles dans les données exprimées en pourcentage , explique Frédéric Fleury-Payeur , démographe à l ’ Institut de la statistique du Québec ( ISQ ) . « Si on s ’ attend à voir environ 60 décès et qu ’ il y en a finalement 80 , ça donne 33 % de plus , ce qui peut avoir l ’ air plus frappant que ça l ’ est en réalité , car les fluctuations sont normales . » Cela dit , au cours des 18 derniers mois , la mortalité réelle a pratiquement toujours dépassé la mortalité anticipée pour les 0 à 49 ans . « Alors oui , on peut se dire qu ’ il y a des phénomènes derrière les chiffres . » Crise des opioïdes ? Parmi les pistes d ’ explication , M. Fleury-Payeur mentionne la crise des opioïdes , qui fait les manchettes depuis plusieurs mois . « On sait que le Québec est beaucoup moins affecté par cette crise que les autres provinces , par exemple la Colombie-Britannique . Mais on sait qu ’ il y a quand même une hausse ici depuis quelques années . Cela touche en majorité les jeunes adultes , donc il se peut que cela se reflète dans les données que nous recueillons . » Dans le reste du Canada , la crise des opioïdes a des impacts autrement importants : ces dernières années , le taux de mortalité chez les personnes âgées de 25 ans à 40 ans y a doublé . « Est-ce cela aussi qui forme une partie de la réponse au Québec ? Est-ce qu ’ il y a aussi eu plus de décès dans les collisions routières ? Il va falloir attendre les données annuelles qui nous sont fournies par les coroners , les enquêtes sur les décès suspects et les morts violentes .

The document examines the historical and current usage of these powers in the US, emphasizing the importance of a balanced and restrained approach. The guide clarifies that there are 123 different statutory powers that may become available to the president during a national emergency, and that these powers come into effect with the simple declaration of an emergency. The guide also explains how these powers can impact civil liberties, war-making power, and the functioning of government. As emergency powers can be abused or misused, the guide calls for new restrictions on their use to avoid potential autocratic rule. Two Congressional bills, the Article I Act and the National Emergency Reform Act, are proposed to limit the scope of these powers and increase their oversight. The guide concludes by reaffirming the importance of maintaining the balance of powers in the face of crises.']"

The error code 429 signifies ""Too Many Requests."" This is a standard response code in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), indicating that the user has sent an excessive number of requests in a given amount of time.\n\nTwitter\'s API, like many APIs, has rate limit rules to avoid the overuse or abuse of their services. These limits are applied per user or per application on both a 15-minute and a 24-hour basis, ensuring that a single user or app can\'t make too many requests within a short timeframe and overwhelm the server. These limitations might vary depending on whether the requests made are ""read,"" ""write,"" or ""message post"" requests.\n\nIn this context, this error message suggests that the user or the application has exceeded the allowed number of requests to the Twitter API and thus has been temporarily rate-limited. To solve this, the user or the service would have to slow down the rate of their requests and wait out until the rate limit period is reset.\n\nThis error doing so effectively helps prevent one user or application from dominating the server\'s resources. By limiting the frequency of requests, Twitter makes sure that its service remains available, fair, and optimal for all users and applications.']"
