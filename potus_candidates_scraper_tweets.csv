It’s an unfortunate move by his campaign advisors, I don’t think friendly fire is helpful. Donald Trump was the greatest President of the 21st century, and I’m not going to criticize him in response to this late attack.  I’ve met tens of thousands of Iowans across 390+ events here, and they are deeply worried - and so am I - that this “system” won’t allow Donald J. Trump anywhere near the White House again. It seems they will stop at *nothing* to keep him away from power.  I’m worried for Trump. I’m worried for our country. I’ve stood up against the persecutions against Trump, and I’ve defended him at every step. I showed up at the Miami courthouse in solidarity following his first federal indictment. I filed a FOIA demand to the Biden DOJ. I submitted an amicus brief this week with the U.S. Supreme Court calling on them to overturn Colorado’s ruling. I pledged to remove myself from Maine’s & Colorado’s primary ballots if they remove Trump, calling on DeSantis and Haley to do the same.  But we have to open our eyes. Last time it was a man-made pandemic & Big Tech election interference. Now, the same billionaires funding the lawsuits against Trump are the ones trying to prop up Nikki Haley. The same MSM blasting Trump is lavishing praise on Nikki. They want to narrow this to a two-horse race between Trump & Haley, eliminate Trump (one way or other), & trot their puppet into the White House.  We can’t fall for that trap. 1 year from now, we won’t look back and say we were shocked that it happened. We’ll kick ourselves for not stopping it.  Our movement must live on. America-First didn’t start in 2016. It started in 1776. We owe it to our Founding Fathers to do the right thing for our country. I want to save Trump & to save this country. Let’s do it together.

As an independent, my vote always goes to who I think represents me best, not a party, and not the “lessor of two evils.”   4 years ago I volunteered for the Jo Jorgensen campaign because she best represented my views, but after the disastrous last few years, it’s becoming more and more apparent that the Libertarian path is too far from making a real impact. I know and respect each of the main candidates running, and I wish the elections were fair and that America was ready to give them a shot.   Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and there’s a candidate in another party that has risen to the occasion for me.   I met this candidate a few months ago, and not only did I think he was sincere then, but he also made a promise to my friend to free her son on day 1. He then proceeded to make that same promise publicly when I asked him in a Q&A. I believed him then. I still believe him now.  (Free Ross!)  This week I saw him work around the clock, brave insane weather conditions, and answer everyone’s questions, even those who went to the event to call him out. He treats people with respect, is willing to go on all podcasts regardless of ideology, and he’s willing to have real, meaningful conversations, plus he’s young enough (plus has two very young kids) that I know that he’s just as concerned about the future as I am. (He’s got skin in the game!)   I will be registering to vote as a Republican, and my vote has been secured by @VivekGRamaswamy.
