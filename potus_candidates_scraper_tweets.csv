It seems they will stop at *nothing* to keep him away from power.  I‚Äôm worried for Trump. I‚Äôm worried for our country. I‚Äôve stood up against the persecutions against Trump, and I‚Äôve defended him at every step. I showed up at the Miami courthouse in solidarity following his first federal indictment. I filed a FOIA demand to the Biden DOJ. I submitted an amicus brief this week with the U.S. Supreme Court calling on them to overturn Colorado‚Äôs ruling. I pledged to remove myself from Maine‚Äôs & Colorado‚Äôs primary ballots if they remove Trump, calling on DeSantis and Haley to do the same.  But we have to open our eyes. Last time it was a man-made pandemic & Big Tech election interference. Now, the same billionaires funding the lawsuits against Trump are the ones trying to prop up Nikki Haley. The same MSM blasting Trump is lavishing praise on Nikki. They want to narrow this to a two-horse race between Trump & Haley, eliminate Trump (one way or other), & trot their puppet into the White House.  We can‚Äôt fall for that trap. 1 year from now, we won‚Äôt look back and say we were shocked that it happened. We‚Äôll kick ourselves for not stopping it.  Our movement must live on.

As an independent, my vote always goes to who I think represents me best, not a party, and not the ‚Äúlessor of two evils.‚Äù   4 years ago I volunteered for the Jo Jorgensen campaign because she best represented my views, but after the disastrous last few years, it‚Äôs becoming more and more apparent that the Libertarian path is too far from making a real impact. I know and respect each of the main candidates running, and I wish the elections were fair and that America was ready to give them a shot.   Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the case, and there‚Äôs a candidate in another party that has risen to the occasion for me.   I met this candidate a few months ago, and not only did I think he was sincere then, but he also made a promise to my friend to free her son on day 1. He then proceeded to make that same promise publicly when I asked him in a Q&A. I believed him then. I still believe him now.  (Free Ross!)  This week I saw him work around the clock, brave insane weather conditions, and answer everyone‚Äôs questions, even those who went to the event to call him out. He treats people with respect, is willing to go on all podcasts regardless of ideology, and he‚Äôs willing to have real, meaningful conversations, plus he‚Äôs young enough (plus has two very young kids) that I know that he‚Äôs just as concerned about the future as I am.

The Democrats have failed to demonstrate that our lives are as important to them as our votes, and nothing proves this more than the New Jim and Jane Crow of #MassIncarceration, the fact that Black folk make up 13% of the total US population but 37% of the unhoused, and the unacceptable situation with Black maternity and infant mortality rates due to #MedicalApartheid. Our campaign offers a new choice for people on the chocolate side of town as much as for folk on the vanilla side of town and all in between. My Policy Pillars will institute real and lasting #RacialJustice and together we will break the derelict #duopoly that takes Black and all poor and working class folk for granted. #TruthJusticeLove #CornelWest2024 https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/07/clyburn-concerned-biden-standing-black-voters-00134192","Jan 8, 2024 ¬∑ 10:11 PM UTC",1445,97
