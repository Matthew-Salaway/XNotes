Vaccine shedding typically refers to the release of live virus particles from a vaccine recipient's body, which is not an effect of the COVID-19 vaccines as they do not contain live virus particles. Myocarditis is a rare side effect that has been observed in some individuals after receiving the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. However, it is crucial to note that the overall risk of myocarditis from the vaccine is significantly lower compared to the risk of developing myocarditis from a COVID-19 infection.

The HRT is a specialized unit within the FBI primarily tasked with responding to high-risk situations involving hostages or terrorists. The agent wearing the cap could be part of another FBI unit, or simply an individual who obtained the cap through other means.

Immunity against the virus can be acquired through prior infection or vaccination, but the level of protection varies among individuals.

Rather than outright supporting or opposing Taiwan's independence, U.S. policy adheres to the ""One China"" policy while also maintaining unofficial relations with Taiwan.
