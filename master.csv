Many Airbnb hosts rely on consistent furnishings to provide a pleasant experience for their guests, and removing furniture without proper authorization may disrupt this experience and breach contractual agreements. Moreover, some jurisdictions may consider this act as theft or unauthorized possession of property, leading to legal consequences. To avoid any legal or ethical issues, it's advisable to seek explicit permission from the hosts before selling any furniture from their property.

While crime rates may have increased in certain cities, it is not accurate to generalize that all cities are now unsafe. The situation at the border is complex, and although certain areas may face challenges, it is incorrect to assert that the entire border is in chaos. While gas prices have risen, attributing it solely to a loss of energy independence oversimplifies the multifaceted factors influencing global oil markets.
